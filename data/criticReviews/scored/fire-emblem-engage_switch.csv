                                Fire Emblem Engage feels like a step backward in ways that this writer appreciates. Gone are the lessons, and in their place is a genuinely affecting story with plenty of whimsy and epic tactical conquests. It's a great way to kick off the year for the Switch, and also happens to be one of the best-looking games on the platform, too.

                                The only thing that I would change in Fire Emblem engage is the design of the protagonist. Her combination of red and blue does come across as excessively garish to me, even within the context of a very bright and colourful game. I’d keep her character, which is great, but just give her green twintailed hair or something. That’s it, though. That’s the only change I’d make. In every other way, Fire Emblem Engage is everything I love about Fire Emblem, bundled up in a way that does justice to both the classics that got me into the series, and the production values of modern gaming. Brilliant.

                                Fire Emblem: Engage will be welcomed by longtime fans who’ve felt disenfranchised by the direction of recent Fire Emblem games. The battlefields are clever and challenging, the visuals are outstanding, and the social stuff—although mostly unnecessary—isn’t so invasive as to bog down gameplay. The story may be perfunctory, but it’s hard to care when you’re having so much fun unleashing Twin Strike on your enemies.

While it suffers in its story compared to recent releases, it is still an essential for tactical RPG fans. It also happens to be a gorgeous game that shines on the OLED Switch display.

The game feels fresh and new while also paying homage to Fire Emblem’s storied past with the inclusion of iconic characters in the Emblem Rings such as Marth, Roy, Lyn, and more. With a collection of adorable characters you’re sure to cry when you lose them and a story that has its fair share of twists and turns; new and old Fire Emblem fans can find something to enjoy about this game. It’s a story of friendship, family, and doing whatever you can to save the ones you love; Fire Emblem.

The shift in tone and style helps set the game apart from what came before, and the new mechanics bring a breath of fresh air to combat while paying tribute to all the games that came before. I was surprised to find a level of difficulty that Three Houses had, for the most part, not showcased – paired with a story with enough twists and turns to keep me interested. While players may be tempted to judge Fire Emblem Engage on the art style alone, I strongly suggest giving it a try before casting judgement; you may just find that this is one of the best Fire Emblem games to date.

With the introduction of the Breach and the numerous mechanics related to synchronization, the guys from Intelligent Systems have indeed added new layers of depth to an already sublime strategic component and to the customization of the party, offering an always adequate and pressing level of difficulty . However, the proverbial - and somewhat unexpected - icing on the cake is represented by a visual system of great impact and more than satisfactory technical performances, which represent a surprising step forward compared to what was seen in Three Houses. Whether or not you know the various heroes recalled from the past, we suggest you make it your own and let yourself be enchanted by a brilliant and varied combat system.

The worst parts of it are merely okay, and the best parts of it paint a bright picture for the future of the franchise. I have never played a game quite so ravenously, sinking over ninety hours into my first playthrough in just two weeks (though don’t get too intimidated by that number, it counts all of my resets from playing on Hard difficulty, and I also played all fifteen optional chapters). At the end of it all I didn’t feel exhausted or burnt out, but rather like I somehow wished that I could play for even longer. Fire Emblem Engage may not check every box that fans were hoping for, but it is easily the strongest showing for the series in the last decade.

Players looking for deep customization, expertly crafted strategy RPG combat, and a heartfelt story with adoration for more than 30 years of Fire Emblem history will find that and more in Engage. It’s one of the most gripping games I’ve played on Switch and, ultimately, one I struggled to peel myself away from. If Three Houses was an experiment with where Fire Emblem’s social mechanics can go, then Engage is doing the same for the series’ evolving combat, and excelling just as much, too.

                                With Fire Emblem Engage, the Nintendo Switch offers itself a first quality exclusivity at the start of 2023. Like Three Houses, the fights are always fluid and accessible, and even benefit from spectacular animations which reinforce the pleasure of play. also in depth thanks to the Emblem Fusion mechanic which offers tools to approach situations with intelligence. Beyond the quality of the design of its friendly characters, the title also shines with its successful graphic rendering for the Nintendo Switch, even if we note sometimes poor environments and a static staging. Finally, it is more by its not always practical menus and its classic story and more interventionist than Three Houses that the experience is a little fishing. Not enough to sulk the pleasure of this new Fire Emblem which remains an excellent way to start the year controller in hand.

                                It’s refreshing to play a Fire Emblem that places such an emphasis on tactical depth as Fire Emblem Engage. Not because the series wasn’t known for it,
but because recent entries have placed a stronger focus on the social aspects.
Engage is, in that sense, a return to form for the series.

                                Fire Emblem Engage is a title that presents you with an entertaining story and unique characters. Add to that tactical and in-depth combat, creating an excellent whole. This is complemented by colorful graphics and good audio. That the social aspects are limited and the activities in the central hub Somniel are not that engaging should be taken for granted, because the rest of the game is more than fine.

                                Fire Emblem Engage is a great celebration of a more than 30 years old franchise, and also one of the best looking Switch games of the last months. We dare to say it's not one of the best episodes in the franchise, but it is, nonetheless, a great SRPG if you have at least fifty hours to invest in it.

                                All in all, I think Fire Emblem Engage is worth checking out. It’ll be a pretty appealing entry for both long-time and new Fire Emblem Fans, the Engage mechanic adds a fun layer to the already excellent combat system, and the bevy of new characters introduced are all generally entertaining. The look of the game is fantastic on the aging Switch hardware, bolstered by the excellent character designs, and the music is really well done. It might not be the best Fire Emblem on the Switch, but it’s still a really solid adventure regardless.

                                While Engage didn't win me over with its story, the mechanics are a different matter. I'm pleased that level grinding is being sidestepped in such a clever manner, though I still miss it. I loved how intense the battles are, every single time. Even with the Time Crystal, the stakes feel terribly high. Sure, the narrative feels more cliché than I'm used to. I wish it wasn't a good vs evil fetch quest. But the character bonds still tell a compelling tale all on their own. And though I didn't love the side content this time around, I'm still happy there's so much of it available. Overall, Fire Emblem Engage is an excellent entry in the franchise. You won't want to miss this one.

                                Fire Emblem Engage is a great Fire Emblem title that focuses on its core roots, the tactical RPG elements; more so its combat. The story is fun, if straightforward, but by aiming for the battle mechanics of the game, Intelligent Systems has been able to make the series’ best combat to date. The addition of the Emblem Rings and what they bring to the characters and their customisation opens a better progression system for each hero while adding more elements to change how one should approach battle scenarios. Throw in some little quality-of-life improvements and new weapon behaviour and this is a Fire Emblem that enjoys celebrating its past heroes and games, but keeps the battles rejuvenated with these new mechanics to push it forward rather than leaving the gameplay stuck in the past where its heroes have come from.

                                Fire Emblem Engage is a more single-minded entry in the series than we’ve seen in a while. A lot of the things people may have loved about Three Houses don’t return here, and the battles are left to carry the load. The more focused design is by choice and I respect that, but it didn’t mean the characters and story had to be as diminished as they are. It’s fortunate that the battle mechanics ratchet things up this time, with the new Emblem system and the returning weapon triangle adding compelling strategic layers. Fans of the tactical aspect at the core of Fire Emblem will find a lot to like, but it’s a shame that the overall package isn’t as strong.

                                As an experience more in-line with the pre-Fates era of Fire Emblem, Engage is a worthy celebration of one of Nintendo's longest running and most storied franchises. Despite many flaws, none of them offset the experience so drastically to sour the overall experience, making for another great entry into the gilded halls of Fire Emblem.

                                In some ways, that focus-shift back to SRPG fundamentals feels like a possible course correction after the significant ‘Personafication’ of Three Houses. On the other hand, this game still feels like it strives to marry old-school Fire Emblem with those new ideas. As a fan of older Fire Emblem and strategy games in general, I was thrilled to see the depth of combat and the level to which you can make battling your absolute focus. That’s still true even if Engage doesn’t quite get the balance in its execution right in a way that might put a small subset of Three Houses lovers off. It’s still a tremendously satisfying experience, mind. It’s engaging - sorry, I had to get it in – and an easy recommendation.

                                Fire Emblem Engage’s story is derivative JRPG nonsense and its social elements are skippable, but the game’s battlefield heroics largely make up for its shortcomings. Classic Fire Emblem combat mechanics make their welcome return here and are nicely elevated by the new Engage system and a slate of varied, surprisingly-challenging maps. Fire Emblem Engage won’t be everybody’s favorite entry in the series, but it should be a critical hit with many seasoned generals.

                                Rather than following up on 2018’s hit Fire Emblem: Three Houses by repeating its exact playbook, the new tactical RPG is a quick regroup for the long-running series. It looks to reinforce its core combat hook with new systems, like adding extra armor plating onto an ax-wielding knight. It may seem like a step back at a glance, but it's more a lateral move that ensures the series can safely fight its next battle.

Also, real efforts have been made to improve the gameplay, and the interface is well thought out. It's a real pleasure to play and watch the fights, which are always accompanied by good animations and music.

It seems like a game undecided whether it wants to spend its time celebrating the past or leaving its own mark on the series, and doesn’t really do either. Combat is definitely its strongest point, and here tactical RPG fans will find much to appreciate, but other systems feel like they are there out of sense of obligation rather than being designed to fully complement it.

                                Fire Emblem Engage is a return to the series' more established format, and the renewed emphasis on combat and strategy is a boon. Yet these improvements come at the cost of losing the charm and character depth seen in Three Houses. Ideally, there needs to be a path forward that combines the best of both approaches, and in that regard, Engage feels like a missed opportunity. Additionally, the developers really need to address some quality of life issues that kill the pacing, especially when it comes to interacting with your home base. It’s a good effort, but it definitely falls short of the total package we’ve come to expect from Fire Emblem.

The story isn't exactly original, the gameplay isn't exactly innovative, and there's perhaps a bit too much emphasis on nostalgia (nostalgia that English language fans can't even truly appreciate, given how many Fire Emblem games didn't get released outside of Japan). However, the game is a treat to view and the combat is just challenging enough to keep you on the edge of your seat even if the same handful of tactics seem to work on every map. Fire Emblem Engage neither stands above the other Fire Emblem games nor does it fall below them. It firmly sits in the middle of the pack, which should be good enough for most fans of the franchise but might not appeal to those who haven't really experienced the franchise before.
