                                Look, I can wax poetic about this absolute wonder all I want, but you’ve got to play it to really see how epic this game is. Not even the biggest nitpicker could find a thing to make better in this, because it just does such a damn good job of being exactly what it aims to be. Do you like music? Do you like action games with a bit of platforming? Do you like charm and atmosphere in your games? If you answered “yes” to any one of those three, go boot up your console or PC of choice and find this gem. You owe it to yourself.

                                I simply can’t imagine not seeing Chai and 808 again, whether it’s in another game or some kind of animated spinoff. As triple-A gaming starts to feel more homogenized each year, Hi-Fi Rush is a stark reminder of how this industry was built on taking chances and experimenting. It’s a gutsy move from a developer known for only making “spooky” games, but it’s a gamble that’s clearly paid off.

                                Hi-Fi Rush is a perfect bit-sized roller coaster, the kind you want to ride again and again. No game is perfect, but Hi-Fi Rush manages to pack in extremely successful and unique gameplay, highly detailed cutscenes and art style, and the comfort of a Saturday morning cartoon's plot, characters, and humor into one awesome adventure that nobody saw coming. Hi-Fi Rush is an absolutely fantastic game and you should go play it right now.

                                Hi-Fi Rush is the perfect surprise to fend off the January blues. A creatively-uplifting adventure that feels like a seismic breath of fresh air amidst copious license bait, remakes and sequels. It is Tango Gameworks’ most cohesive project yet, and a sorely-needed top-quality Xbox exclusive to boot. Few games can proudly go toe to toe with something as stylistically groundbreaking as Jet Set Radio, but Hi-Fi Rush sits comfortably within that lineage thanks to its intuitive full-bodied combat system, masterful art direction and anti-capitalist story. What can I say? It’s an early Game of the Year contender that’ll make you want to go and pick up that dusty old acoustic.

                                One of the most joyous and fun gaming experiences we've had in a very long time, 'Hi-Fi Rush' combines the best of classics like 'Jet Set Radio', 'Space Channel 5', and 'Bayonetta' into a delectable package that simply can't be missed.

                                Like other rhythm games, what starts as frantic button-mashing turns into rewarding jam sessions. As you learn to time your strikes to the beat, you'll face an escalating range of robot foes that fight back (also on tempo, of course). It's a dance paired with an amazing soundtrack, and — funky as it sounds — I promise, it works.

                                 Hi-Fi Rush came out of nowhere and made a name for itself in everyone's hearts, including myself. This is a rythm-action-platforming game that does almost everything well, which at the same time certainly makes up for its tiny issues. To sum up: this game by Tango Gameworks is a fresh and funny adventure that is packed with action, and that features several characters that are more than ready to take on the main stage.

                                Hi-Fi RUSH is a surprise hit for many, but frankly, that shouldn’t come as a surprise. Tango Gameworks once more has proven itself to be an immensely talented studio, with showstopping animation and stylish artwork. It’s one of the strongest entries in the character action genre yet, only further bolstered by an accessible focus on music to have you nailing that combo to the catchy beats. It is a joy to see protagonist Chai and his ragtag crew fighting the higher power and see that world grow for what is hopefully not the only time. Every needle-drop moment and thrilling boss fight and encounter all but emphasise one thing: Hi-FI RUSH is magic and already a serious game-of-the-year contender. Rock on.

                                Despite being a black sheep of Tango Gamework's library, Hi-Fi Rush is quickly setting itself up to be a standout in popularity as well as genre, having already become a massive hit despite being a complete unknown mere hours before it released. With any luck, the budding success of Hi-Fi Rush encourages more game developers to stretch their wings and experiment. Sometimes stepping out of your comfort zone can really pay off, and in this reviewer's opinion, Hi-Fi Rush epitomizes that.

                                I swear Hi-Fi Rush could be a premier cartoon series. It’s got best-in-class animation, endearing heroes to cheer for, and villains you love to hate, all wrapped in good-natured humor. But on top of that everlasting charm, it turns a dynamic rock soundtrack into its greatest weapon, putting meticulous detail into syncing the beat to all aspects of the experience. It gives combat a uniquely satisfying momentum that other stylish-action games don’t offer, even when the platforming and targeting system drop a couple notes along the way. Hi-Fi Rush is a memorable journey that marches to the beat of its own drum and without a doubt stands among the action greats.

The game is both accessible to newcomers to rhythm games and very challenging for veterans looking to be tested in several other areas that don't necessarily have to do with just rhythm games. The combat is varied, the combos you learn are great to execute, and the music is a joy to listen to. Overall, a great success.
