                                Forspoken isn't perfect, owing to a middling campaign and a need for more optimization. Still, its spell combat system and parkour mechanics are top-notch, with landscapes and abilities that can truly amaze.

                                If you are looking for a new open world game to explore with an innovative but clunky combat system, and you have a high-end computer to get around the technical problems, Forspoken might be the game for you. However, you'd better not have high expectations regarding its story or dialogues, because at best they are not great, and at worst, you will even think about doing the unthinkable: skip the cinematics.

                                Neat action-adventure with role-playing elements, which surprises with
many fresh ideas, while ultimately implementing them inconsistently.

                                Forspoken occasionally has small sparks of greatness, but then quickly douses itself in fear of ever being anything other than an upsettingly safe open-world RPG.

                                Its initial teasers promised a gorgeous magical world full of incredible sites.  Instead, weâ€™ve been given something boring, that runs terribly and has a story full of overused tropes.

                                Forspoken is not worth either your money, or your time. Even were it offered for free, perhaps as part of a free weekend promotion on Steam, or as one of the rotating weekly free game giveaways on the Epic Games Store, it would still be too high a price to pay, as the time investment costs far outweigh the doubtful pleasure of experiencing what little Forspoken has to offer.
