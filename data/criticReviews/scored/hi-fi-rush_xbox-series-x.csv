                                What likely started out as an Xbox and/or Bethesda executive thinking “Hey, wouldn’t it be neat if we kept this game a secret and launched it during a special event?” has led to what could easily wind up as one of this year’s GOTY contenders exploding onto the scene in spectacular fashion. Hi-Fi Rush is classic video game action that blends amazing combat in a unique hybrid of genres in with memorable characters, a wicked sense of humor, terrific gameplay that’s accessible for all players and mind-blowing visuals and music. It’s an instant classic, even without the shadow drop, and delivers a candy-coated blast of chaos that conceals a clear labor of love and a weird purity to it all that you need to experience.

It’s the type of game that reminds you why you fell in love with the genre in the first place.

                                Hi-Fi Rush is a rock-themed masterpiece rhythm-action game. Its combat makes you feel like you’re performing on stage, and its wholesome story is exhilarating throughout. In 2023, there is simply no rhythm-action game that we could recommend more.

Don’t let the rhythm-based combat scare you, just give it a try and you’ll be tapping your feet and buttons to the beat in no time.

From the very beginning, Tango Gameworks' title grabbed us by the collar and never let us go until the end credits, and we're asking for more. From its original concept executed with a cheeky mastery to its setting filled with a fine and universal humor, this is a project of enthusiasts for enthusiasts, you can feel it and it obviously warms your heart.

It is, quite literally, infectious, as you will not only find yourself involuntarily bopping along with the beat as you play, but even after you’ve shut the game off...

                                This is an impeccable platform and action title, which bases all its gameplay on the rhythm of the music and which makes everything have outstanding fluidity. The difficulty of timing is adjustable so just about anyone can enjoy the game, pulling off combos and powerful attacks without having to be a timing ace. The protagonists and the final bosses have an exquisite personality and designs and give more power to a story that has its plot twists and its slightly more emotional and profound moments. Although Hi-Fi RUSH doesn't have an epic story, it has everything necessary to captivate you from the beginning, and together with that feeling of fluidity when playing, it leaves a very good taste in the mouth after a few hours at the controls. The game improves until practically its end, so we won't be able to stop playing until we discover what SPECTRA is and what they want to use it for. In addition, once we complete Hi-Fi RUSH, we can replay the levels to discover each and every one of the secrets that the levels hide, so we have an incentive to play them again. Or if you are a completionist, you have at your disposal the Wall of Fame, where a good handful of challenges await you. As you can see, Hi-Fi RUSH has everything it takes to become a title that many of us will remember over the years. If you are a fan of platform games, action games, or you just like music and video games, you have to give Hi-Fi RUSH a try, I assure you that you will not regret it.

                                What you will remember about Hi-Fi Rush is just how charming it is. It’s so rare for a game from one of the major developers to take a creative risk, and Hi-Fi Rush does just that. Not only is the core of the game innovative, but the way each character is written takes a big risk of having people switch off before they develop and you grow to love them. I hope Hi-Fi Rush is incredibly successful. I hope it teaches the industry that creative innovation can also create profits, and we see more new and interesting ideas from the big boys in the future.

                                This is a world that, robot assassins aside, is pleasurable to exist within and to explore, made all the sweeter by virtue of its unexpected arrival.

                                Hi-Fi Rush arrived by surprise, unassumingly, without many compromises, and just like a rock star, it uses its personality to get the audience off the ground and mark everyone with a memorable experience. Although it still has an air of ""experimentation"" with bold gameplay but knows how to ""step on the brakes,"" Chai's adventure can quietly be considered one of the best surprises of recent times, and is probably what many gamers were needing but didn't know yet.

                                Hi-Fi Rush is a charming action game with a great art style, fun characters, and solid mechanics. Sometimes, that's all you need.

                                Tango Gameworks breaks from expectation to release a bold rhythm-action game where combat isn't set to the sound of music but driven by it entirely. With its awesome battles, vivid visual design, and unwavering commitment to comedy, Hi-Fi Rush is an undeniably wild ride that shouldn't be ignored.

                                Hi-Fi RUSH is an absolute delight. A simple idea that could have been extremely difficult to correctly develop, Hi-Fi RUSH is a real joy to play. Here's hoping that there are many more brilliant surprises to come this year, as Hi-Fi RUSH sets a high bar.

                                A very welcome surprise, that is one of the most enjoyably unique games on Xbox and one of the best rhythm action games in a very long time - as well as having arguably the best cel-shaded graphics ever seen.

                                Hi-Fi Rush is oozing with style and confidence, but like a messy first album, there are some deep cut tracks that don’t hit as hard as the opening few hits. What can’t be denied, however, is how excited we are for the sophomore effort, and the seemingly limitless versatility that Tango Gameworks have shown off in this bold, out-of-nowhere joy.

                                For someone who also works in music journalism, my skills are shaky, to say the least. But, having taken the time to improve these skills, I now feel better equipped to appreciate the game for what it is: a fun, quirky, sometimes weird, and often cheesy critique of capitalism. When I was less focused on how perfectly I was playing, I had a much better time headbanging through each stage. Just give me a wider variety of music next time and I’m sold.

                                Settling into Hi-Fi Rush's groove might require a recalibration - in your head, if not the latency settings - and the rewards are more intermittent than we'd like, but when they come, they're considerably greater than the occasional cheer from a non-existent audience.

                                Hi-Fi Rush is a nice surprise from Tango Gameworks. The originality of the combat system, halfway in the world of rhythm games, is a gimmick that gives the game its strength but also its biggest weakness, making it repetitive. With ten hours to finish the game, it's not a torture either.
