                                Forspoken is a good idea that is unable to build the playable and narrative style to make it shine. We want to explore its world, but there's not much to do, nor does the story push you to do so. [Not Recommended]

                                Forspoken takes it time to get over a wobbly start, but there's something worthwhile here amongst the noise.

                                I’ll come back here and rate the game once I’ve finished the last chapter. However, I’m not convinced that it’s going to become any more magical and entertaining than it is now. It’s a shame, because the game starts from a good place: A new fantasy IP with a take-no-prisoners female protagonist. And I can tell that a lot of the people who worked on the game were sincerely trying. But I can also tell that several others very much were not.

                                Forspoken deserves better than what shipped on January 24. The strength of its story and protagonist do outpace its many problems, but much like Frey’s early struggles in seeing her own greatness, it’s clouded by unfortunate circumstances.

                                Forspoken’s final hours feature a bizarre difficulty curve, where I found myself absolutely destroying certain bosses before the full dialogue could even play out, only to then be pitted against the big bad who, among other things, featured a one-hit kill cleverly disguised as a cutscene.

                                There’s a fascinating story and incredible parkour action buried under lackluster combat and a game lacking technical polish.
