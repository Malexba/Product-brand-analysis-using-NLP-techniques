It’s actually impressive, it’s like the developers decided to be inspired by the worse games to ever release. I’d like to say that the gameplay makes up for its shortcomings like other reviews have but I just can’t, the “parkour” movement system gets old real quick, and the combat (despite being the strongest part of the game) also suffers the same fate, after a few hours you just begin to ask the question why am I even playing this?

RB7,http://www.metacritic.com/user/RB7,"Jan 26, 2023",2,Negative,"I was looking forward to this game from the trailers, however this is a other miss from Square Enix. It's great to see a person of colour as the protagonist but the writing fails her miserably. She is unbelievably boring and this is highlighted with her interactions with the just as uninteresting NPC's. The dialogue between her and Cuff is so cringy they give you and option to dial it back. The premise is actually interesting but the execution of it is poor. The amount of hand holding and black screens make the beginning of the game a slog and a chore to play. This results in the plot overall being uninteresting to me and doesn't come close to capturing the imagination. The open world feels empty even though there are things to do. This is because they don't give a good enough reason to actually do side quests/things on the map. It feels like they just randomly put things on the map without any thought. Gameplay feels decent but only against bigger enemies does it feel satisfying. Against smaller enemies it feels u rewarding. The game also doesn't run well on PC. This is what I and most PC gamers are expected and currently experiencing. The writing was on the wall for how bad the PC version would be as no PC codes were sent to reviewers before launch, which is a major red flag.Ultimately Forspoken fails on a lot of levels, and the game being $10 more than usual is just pathetic. This is a game that'll be heavily discounted in a couple of months because of how bad it is, so save your money and only buy it if the discount is around 60%/70% off and above.",16,23,0.6956521739130435
SophieTass,http://www.metacritic.com/user/SophieTass,"Jan 26, 2023",0,Negative,"The game is plagued with a laundry list of issues that stem from choices the designers made. They created an expansive world that ended up being a barren wasteland. A forgettable and unappealing world , reminiscent of games like Death Stranding and Sonic Frontiers. As unsatisfactory as the world feels, the gameplay felt more off-putting still. A clumsy UI to select different abilities and repetitive combat that feels unsatisfying and unrewarding. The unpleasant dialogue makes the main character very unlikeable throughout the game. A game designed with very little care, with a very high price tag.

tjr074,http://www.metacritic.com/user/tjr074,"Jan 25, 2023",4,Negative,"Can be fun at times but it's mostly a mess. I got this for the PS5 because Square has a history of messing up PC ports with terrible optimization and performance but I can say the performance here is pretty bad. I like to play with at least 60 fps but even in performance mode it obviously drops below that constantly. Constant stutters even in closed rooms, combat and open world have even worse with stuttering. Any other mode runs 30 fps and still has some noticeable stuttering and frame rate drops. Graphics are OK but I certainly wouldn't call them great. Games like God of War: Ragnarok, Horizon and many others all look better and perform much better. Gameplay and combat can be fun but there's nothing special or really all that new. Story is not terrible but not great, the main character is completely unlikable which really takes away from my engagement. I haven't finished the game yet so maybe she gets better. Pacing is way off. Long stretches of boring, insignificant story and wondering around the city go on far too long before getting to any actual action. It's fine for a little bit, but this is way too long. I may make it through the game, I may not. I may also just shelve it for a few months and try again to see if Square actually releases any patches to fix the performance but they aren't known for putting out timely patches so I'm not holding my breath.

Apparently there is a narrative but good luck figuring out what it is, as the writing is terrible. Not even the gameplay or game world are well done. The combat and traversal just feel too floaty, the ""enemies"" (a lot of which are just animals in the game world) are the most generic dull creations you can imagine. Then you have numbers spilling out all over the place during combat which looks awful, then there's the graphics which seem to switch between reasonable looking to low rez 720p and lower.

royalguy07,http://www.metacritic.com/user/royalguy07,"Feb  2, 2023",6,Mixed,"Forspoken, the first game from developer Luminous Productions and published by one of 2022's gaming punching bags Square Enix (deservedly so), is a new IP open world action adventure game. There is nothing particularly engaging or innovative in its design, especially in the very rough opening hours, leaving you and the character to explore a fairly bland and empty world. Forspoken has seemingly been in development hell since it was announced a few years ago. It received several delays including twice just in the last 10 months. You would think this would of given Luminous time to fine tune the product but while the game isn't buggy in the literal sense it is very choppy and disorganized just in its movement, cutscene/dialogue transitions, and combat. Once you start unlocking different spell types and more spell options the combat does become a lot more fun, it allows there to be almost no down time and keeps the combat feeling very fast-paced. The main story only takes roughly 10 hours to beat, and the game takes probably 6-8 hours to get its footing, which you can probably see the problem with. The story starts off very rough but manages to settle in to an acceptable if standard and predictable pattern of the reluctant hero trope. Frey initially will do nothing unless it is in direct interest of helping her escape this new land she has been transported to. Her motivations don't really change until late in the game when the twist and true antagonist of the game is revealed. I will say that the twist is handled well, but it is one of the most easily predictable twists in gaming history. Seasoned gamers will be able to easily pick up on it in the middle stages of the story. Graphically is hit or miss, some of the vistas and environments are well done but as you get closer to things all the brightness kind of washes away. There is a lot of artificial fog that severely hampers the draw distance. Enemy design is pretty putrid here, there are some standard zombies, zombified bears and wolves, and some ugly gray/brown masses to fight. The facial animations range from decent to hilariously bad, and its just bizarre that somehow the worst facial animations are all on the main character, who's mouth just will not stay in step with the dialogue. Overall, it was a fun 20 hour romp through a well structured but dull/standard 3rd person action RPG. Definitely not worth the full retail price.",1,1,1.0

Meta-Mortal,http://www.metacritic.com/user/Meta-Mortal,"Feb  1, 2023",5,Mixed,"Square Enix took a stab at a new IP and did a solid job. Gameplay is excellent and those who have played the DMC series will find a great deal to be excited about when creating new combos to raise your ""style ranking"" (or this games version of it.)The story's concept may be generic but they did exactly what they said they would. Square has been transparent about the kind of game this is and is mostly undeserving of the harsh criticism it gets. The world is built to be a sort of barren wasteland. Many did not approve of this but it fits the the history and lore of Athia quite nicely. The dialogue can make you cringe, but it was few and far between for me. There could be a little more done to make exploring feel more rewarding but my experience wasn't tainted by that as I still enjoyed what it had to offer.Character design is quite nice and the combat runs smoothly. Especially once you learn how to weave together your ""flow"" abilities to set up for devastating magic and open windows for support magic.This game sets up something special. This one has it's imperfections but I can see a sequel ironing out the kinks and making something truly exceptional.I feel it's worth noting that after 45+ hours of gameplay I still have yet to encounter any glaring bugs in the game. A rarity in a time where nearly every game releasing is riddled with them. Load times are very fast. I can rarely drink my water.From what I can tell, most criticism falls on very nit-picky topics. To be fair, games are quite expensive and people should be completely happy with a product before shelling out the cash.But the demo before release was pretty accurate though they made improvements. Square Enix constantly updated potential fans on what they could expect and have delivered as far as I can tell. They didn't oversell the game either.

Maximuswall,http://www.metacritic.com/user/Maximuswall,"Jan 28, 2023",5,Mixed,"Don't listen to Ondores lies!!! Forspoken is perplexing. My first experience was with the games demo. Before me lay a huge barren play ground of grassy fields, tall tall mountains and enough map markers to make Ubisoft proud. Pushing forward on my joystick (taking note of the slight delay) while pressing circle I found myself boundlessly leaping and running at a break neck speed watching some of the most brilliant parkour animations appear before my eyes. I came to what looked like a majestic elk until I noticed the goldish/green rock-rot that was pretending from it's otherwise furry coat... It's a trap! I thought to my self as I slammed on my four shoulder triggers attempting to unravel a way to complicated battle system with little to no explanation on how to use this. I shut the game off. About four days later I was scouring my PS5 dashboard when I decided I'd try again, while I found the battle clumsy (and the fps uneven) I really liked the traversal. This time before I got started I got aquatinted with the battle system as I looked at the controls in the settings I also noticed a 120hz mode. I turn it on. Game changer! The fps now hovers a 40fps and the controller lag is much better. I can now play the game in fidelity not a sub 1080p the performance mode offered. I played for three hours, I loved the battle system. It was very different then anything I played in quite a while. Pushing in on r3 I locked onto a enemy. I could then run parkour around them leaping and dashing away from attacks while returning fire and rock in a blitz of spells that allows strategic offensives against each enemy. I really liked this and I wanted to buy the game.    When it releases I was surprised to see how low the game actually scored. It was obvious that there were deep flaws here but it also had quite a fun hook. I decided to buy it anyway. You are Fray a 20yr old girl orphaned in N.Y. city that after getting into trouble with the law and losing everything she has finds a portal to the magical world of ""Athia"". The game is beautiful, large open spaces designed around the parkour system makes up several districts of the map connected to one main city. Each area contains several challenges mostly based on the combat systems magical take on action adventure/rpg made possible by the supporting character ""cuff"" that grants Fray these abilities.In the far corners lie the ""Tanta's"" this world matriarchs and former benevolent rulers that were twisted by ""the break"" a magical plague that distorts and mutates everything caught in it's miasma except for you. After defeating a Tanta you take on their elemental powers.   The game is a lot of fun but definitely divisive. The first thing, the most important thing is the combat. If you can click with the combat/parkour mechanics then the game will open up for you if not it will fail to entertain because we'll that's really all the game offers. There are hundreds of points of interest on the map but ultimately this is a dead world and all it offers is parkour and combat, for some it's enough but a lot of people will want more. Another issue was how much better it felt in 120hz a mode that is not available to everyone. The smaller issues relate to a script that can be abrasive and a all around feeling that the budget ran out before the game was finished. There are no day/night cycle despite building camps and finding rest shelters. Some of the animation are really stiff in cut scenes as well as being forced to stay stationary at time during exposition dumps that don't really need . Also speaking of exposition dumps... There are a ton of them and they are mostly made in writing causing the pace of the game to slow to a crawl.  With all that said, I personally loved the combat, the world and the characters. This game was so much fun during the times it let you go and just explore Athia that it overshadowed the dull moments. This game is not for everyone but if you can get into the demo then this might be for you. Id give it a 7.5 out of 10 and with a little fine tuning it could easily be patched to an 8. I gave it a higher meta score because of the review bombing from trolls. This game has a audience out there I'm proof of that. I hope it finds it's place",4,6,0.6666666666666666

triprobert77,http://www.metacritic.com/user/triprobert77,"Jan 27, 2023",7,Mixed,I do understand there are legitimate criticism for this game. Cliched story and some cringey (but no where near what people are saying) dialogue make it shine less than it would with an original story and impactful dialogue. The people giving this game a zero is something I don’t understand. I know this game is not a genre defining game. Everyone has their opinion but i thought a zero is a completely nonfunctional game that is unplayable. You can adjust the dialogue options. I’m not saying that all the negative reviews are from people mad about a protagonist that is a woman or a person of color but I would not be surprised that is what a couple are about. The combat is tight and responsive. The magical parkour is a blast to float through your environment. The rpg element is not incredibly deep but enough to keep me interested throughout the game so far. I love games that have a system to customize clothing and it affects your character. It’s nothing like cyberpunk 2077 but there are some options that allow for customization that increases stats. It’s a slow start but once you can free roam it’s worth it for me. The game is not a visual masterpiece but running in quality mode which is 4K (no ray tracing) with decent frame rates it’s a pretty game. I’m enjoying myself. It does suffer from standard checklist gaming but it does not bother me but I do understand it can bother others. I’m am playing on the PS5 so I’m unsure about the PC version. I’ve heard there are some issues so I would probably wait for some patches or better optimization. I like games in this category so I’m enjoying myself maybe more than others but it is a very fun game for me. If you’re not a huge fan of fantasy rpg probably wait for a sale. I would recommend the game but maybe not at full price for people who just want a casual experience.,8,13,0.6153846153846154

It literally has the same humor as the recent She Hulk.  The positive here is at least it's not an existing intellectual property being trashed.  The main character is completely unlikable with no redeeming qualities.  She is literally nasty to people that just helped her to an unnatural level where it doesn't even make sense.  If the gameplay is just average the story and characters need to make up for it which this game doesn't.  Stop listening to the few woke extra loud squeaky wheels and in quotes ""professional"" game critics that are activist in disguise.  Honestly diversity even made sense in the beginning of this game but to overdo it with making every single person in power a women looks like it was just pushing an agenda instead of focusing on making a good game.  Diversity is good and won't ruin a good game but forced diversity can make an average game bad which the user scores clearly show.  Average game play, average graphics, points for being weird, not likable main character, and way to many other games to play to finish this one.  The game is a typical 6 but a 0 for forced diversity making it a 3.  It can be immersion breaking & immersion is the whole reason people like Square Enix games.  You kill immersion you kill Square Enix.  I play videogames to escape the politics of this stupid world and when even I can pull out a scorecard while playing a game something is really wrong.

I had a few questions in my mind as I'm progressing through the story, and I'm not sure if I didn't focus enough on the storyline or if it's an actual plot-hole. for example (--SPOILER ALERT--) why tf Cinta was the only one who turned into a dragon and other Tantas just went crazy? and obviously Cinta didn't go crazy right? because she protected Frey and told her the whole truth about her life. idk I felt like at the end it was sooo rushed that so many things in the story didn't make sense to me. and Cuff, even before it was revealed that he was the ""devil"" he just felt really off and he gave so many hints that maybe he's the enemy. it wasn't the best plot twist. it just feels like they put so much effort on the combat (which btw it's amazing) that they forgot about the rest that makes a game, ""a good game"". honestly it had so much potential but they rushed it at the end to get that cash.

К сожалению, на этом достоинства заканчиваются. Я поиграл в неё 3 часа, с надеждой, что вот-вот станет лучше, но становилось только скучнее, а недостатков появлялось все больше и больше. Начнем с того, что графически игра выглядит гораздо хуже большинства игр поколения PS4. Нью-Йорк из Spider Man или Division выглядел гораздо более живым, красивым и детализированным. Освещение в Forspoken отвратительное, там где все проблемные участки можно было спрятать освещением или режиссурой сцены - абсолютная пустота. Открытый мир Атии, или как он там, вообще напоминает ММО, абсолютно пустые и голые поля с группами врагов, которые просто стоят и ничего не делают, пока не подойдешь их бить. Геймплей как был скучным в деске, так таким же и остался. Циферки, выпадающие из них в интерфейсе на момент написания отзыва не отключались. Может бы вытащил все это дело сюжет, но увы, он на таком низком уровне, что лучше бы его просто не было. С момента, когда в доме героини начинается пожар и она уже будучи одетой просто игнорирует сумку с деньгами пока не найдет кошку... Ну, вы сами должны увидеть эту сцену, ничего, абсолютно ничего не мешало её взять эту сумку за 2 секунды, которая стояла прямо перед ней, а потом спасти кошку. Я понимаю, что таким образом сценаристы хотели ""раскрыть героя"", мол она выбрала спасти кошку и лишилась всего, но это не делается так тупо. Далее побег из башни-тюрьмы, мы сбегаем, тревога, весь город на ушах, нас все ищут стража прочесывает каждый уголок. Но уже с утра в этом же городе всем АБСОЛЮТНО наплевать на ваше присутствие. С вами здороваются местные жители, стражники приветствуют и улыбаются.. Эммм, простите что? Я восемь часов назад сбежал из тюрьмы и вы уже ничего не помните? В городе всего человек 100 живет... И вот так у них все, корявые анимации, постоянные зацепы героини за окружение, одинаковые дома, одинаковые текстуры всего, плохое освещение, плохой сюжет, постоянные ""фак, фак , щит, фак, крап, фак , фак"" где это совершенно неуместно. Короче не покупайте это, кроме музыки ничего хорошего в Forspoken нет.",13,22,0.5909090909090909

Такого лютого дерьма я давно не видел. Теперь по фактам.1. Персонажи говны.Главная героиня по всем канонам нынешней повестки нигерша, к тому же ""особенная"". Абсолютно все персонажи крайне бесят в своей тупости, лицемерии и убогости. За пример идти вообще не буду. 3 или 4 шлюхи поссорились и призвали демона. Они его победили, но не победили. Этот самый демон стал браслетами и прикрепился к каждой из этих сук, начав сводить их с ума. Как думаете, эти самые шлюхи, которые являются по совместительству правителями своих земель сделали хоть что то, чтоб уберечь своих подданных? Они их предупредили о том, что сойдут с ума? Нет! Нихуя подобного! В игре же из уст ГГ прозвучало примерно следующее ""Они являлись просто жертвами, а виноват демон"", при том, что именно они его и призвали!2. Логика говны.Тут все просто. Эти браслеты, являющиеся фактически частями демона сводили обладателей с ума. Это правило разрабы сами же и нарушили, показав гг во время сцены после титров, которая спокойно себе живёт с таким браслетом и даже с ним разговаривает. Так же логика вышла из чата потому, что у гг мать и отец белые, но при этом сама ""героиня"" является нигершой. Мать вместо того, чтоб отдать свою дочь отцу, просто выкидывает её в портал. В рандомное место и рандомное время. Попав в детский дом ещё младенцем гг получила имя. Замечу, что она могла получить абсолютно любое, хоть жопа залупина, но при этом эта сука выдает следующее ""так мать меня назвала в ее/его честь"", или что то в этом духе. И так со всем!3. Оптимизация и графика говны.Даже на 4090 ФПС порой падал до 57 кадров + фризы и другого рода говно. Эти партикли вообще бесполезны, хоть они так ими коечились. Можно было сделать куда красивее и менее ресурсозатратно. Графика хуже, чем в атсасине юнити, но это уже мем.4. Сюжет говны.Как и заведено в деловых дерьмоиграх/дерьмоаниме у нас тут гребаный исекай. Бомжиха бросила своего кота и исекайнулась в какой то фентезийный мир. Ее сразу все начали облизывать, мол какая она особенная и необычная, и так далее и так далее. По факту что мы имеем?1) Сплошные плоские клише про избранную/особенную/единственную и неповторимую.2) 12 глава просто зашквар. Все, из чего она состоит, так это из ""слезовыжималок"" и убогой экспозиции, чтоб отбелить боссов игры, мол ""они лишь жертвы, в во всем демон виноват. Такие они хорошие"" и не учитывая того, что именно эти бабы виноваты в смерти их мира.P.S. Эта игра идеально показывает то, что женщины у власти приведут цивилизацию в упадок, если не к полной аннигиляции, после чего перекинут всю вину на кого либо, лишь бы самим не отвечать за свои действия.

Reinhard07,http://www.metacritic.com/user/Reinhard07,"Jan 25, 2023",7,Mixed,"Sin duda la polemica por este título es algo grande ya que se habia anunciado desde hace tiempo como un titulo de impulso desde el anuncio de la consola PS5, por lo que era una promesa de calidad en todos los aspectos para los juagdores. Realmente nadie niega que Forspoken queda a deber en caunto al hype que se tenia, aunque para algunos que jugamos el demo empezamos a sospechar del producto final; y pues no nos equivocamos del todo, el juego es si se ve bien con unos controles del personaje que se siente fluido y que da para muchas combinaciones de magias que en combinacion con los entornos puede llevarnos a realizar coreografias sorprendentes, lo malo de esto es que el mundo abierto en el que nos topamos en el juego está muy vacío (en este aspecto me recordo al mapa de Hyrule en Zelda BOTW), ésto aunado a una paleta de colores en los enemigos del juego resulta medio dofocil diferenciarlos a la distancia; la personalizacion de las magias y de los objetos como capas, collares y hasta el decorado de las uñas que nos confieren diferentes habilidades es grande y como en otros RPG se requiere de materiales para poder mejorarlosl La historia no es tan diferente a otras historias de un protagonista que fue a dar de manera magica a otro universo para ayudar a salvar al mundo (recorde la pelicula de la torre oscura), no es tan compleja y es simple por lo que podras antocipar algunos giros de trama con facilidad. Una de las partes que me gustaron y que disfrute bastatnte fueron las batallas con los jefes, grandes y vistosos caracteristicos de Square Enix. En conclusión es un juego promedio, sin duda le falto mucho la parte innovación ya que muchas de las mecanicas ya fueron vistas en muchos juegos del pasado y se debio poner mas atención en la parte diferenciadora en una IP nueva que pintaba para ser un inicio de saga interesante.

Constant fades to black and silent moments, the already slow pace of the story is further artificially slowed down ad-nauseum. The dialogue is very wooden, cliched and cringey, with awkward pauses between each line. The main character's performance is constantly over-acted and over-performed, over-expressed. Nothing here makes sense. Several dialogue/writing continuity errors. Plot hole every 10 minutes.Somewhat empty and lifeless world to explore.The main character often does things which make her unlikable, it's hard to immerse.Technically it's also badly coded/optimised, a sad reminder that modern developers and coders are using bloated, leaky untidy code. The game looks like it could've come out 8-10 years ago, but it plays like it needs a computer from the future. Overall, the game feels more like the product of board meetings and market research, with no heart or soul. The saving grace is the voice acting for Cuff, and some interesting environments, and some cool creatures/bosses.",9,16,0.5625

TheLiveCoach,http://www.metacritic.com/user/TheLiveCoach,"Jan 26, 2023",3,Negative,"Quite obviously a Square Enix attempt to capitalise on the social justice warrior extremism in European and American markets, going all in out rather woke indoctrination and very skinny on anything else. The story is incredibly simple, numb, generic, PG8 and below at best. Most of it is told in lore pages rather than dialogue, yet the game is absolutely overflowing with cringe, horrible dialogue that you will quickly disable in the settings and still find annoying. The open world is empty, non-interactive, the NPCs, story characters and even the main protagonist are forgettable and very hard to connect to. Frey, the lead, is particularly toxic, unlikeable and absolutely tragic to play with because you more or less would prefer to let her fail in the mission, the objective, the story.. Judge should have given her a sentence in jail and spared us all the agony of this game. Combat had some potential, as did traversal, but it was implemented through a non-intuitive control scheme and experiences constant interruptions to change up spells. If only we could have assigned our favorite spells to certain buttons, had a dodge that wasn't pre-determined and the combat was a ton more fluid, it would have helped stomaching all the rest of the garbage. All in all, there's very little positives to find. The game simply isn't good, it ruined it potential and was released too early. Perhaps with a writing time that wasn't clearly imported from the left extremists kind to write your typical strong black woman victim overcomes it all narrative, it could have been a good game. At the current moment, I'd price it around the same as this review score: 3 bucks. That's what you're getting for it. This being a triple A at 80 bucks is a total disgrace.",5,10,0.5

100Guides,http://www.metacritic.com/user/100Guides,"Jan 27, 2023",7,Mixed,"After playing the game for about 90 hours and finishing 100% of the game I can say that it's not the BEST game in the world, however there is no need to get on the hate train blindly and you should give it a go if you are going in to it with low expectations (you may just like it a little more than you think). The story is short (my 3rd playthrough only lasted 4 hrs, however I was skipping every cutscene since I watched them all in my first playthrough) but personally I liked the writing and I think that if it was much longer the story would not have been as good. The graphics are ok, not anything special but not bad. The effects for some magic elements look cool but thats about it. The combat can be VERY boring at the start, however once you beat a few of the main story bosses, allowing you to combine more types of magic it gets more fun. Also playing against some of the stronger open world bosses on hard can be a challenge and fun to learn. As far as the normal enemies the combat can look cool as you blast through them but gets a little boring when there are a little too long. Moving through the massive open world is by far the best aspect of the game. The movement and speed is really smooth and fun. Exploration is just ""ok"".  The upgrades, cloaks, nails, etc... you get are good and useful, however the activities can get a little repetitive (if you are going for 100% at least). Also I kind of wish everything did not appear on the map once you get close, since in my opinion it takes away some of the magic of exploring and finding something cool.

It just takes away from the immersion when it could have been avoided entirely.- There are TOO MANY sections where all you do is walk slowly towards something. The pacing sucks.- The Magic Parkour starts feeling ok but then you realise 80% of the skills for parkour - some of which you have to go uncover yourself instead of inherit - are literally just “jump higher” skills. - The combat feels poor at first but gets better as you unlock it, however some of the fights are ridiculously unfair, with minions swarming you and 1 hit kills everywhere that you can’t avoid because of the camera angles.- It’s Aesthetically impressive.Definitely buy it if it’s on sale - do not pay full price.",2,4,0.5

Gostei muito da jogabilidade, exploração do mapa, magias, parkour, combate por último trilha sonora. Tem certas pessoas que estão fazendo comentários polêmicos, de que o game está totalmente cagado, que o jogo e um mundo vazio, sofreu downgrade, que isso não vale pena e etc. Como eu não vi isso tudo na minha própria experiencia tão problemática seríssimo grave. Porém tenho uma ressalva, tem uns problemas que seria de desempenho/performance e expressão facial estão feios mesmo, vou simplifica minhas impressões que vi neste game.Gameplay / Jogabilidade – (Satisfatório e bom)Gostei muito do estilo com mistura de magia e parkour e a jogabilidade é bem interessante que considero satisfatório, para quem realmente gosta do estilo classe de mago, temos personagem principal Frey Holland, porem ela tem uma personalidade muito forte, ela era de uma gangue, daí a brutalidade. Gostei muito por parte que temos bastante acesso de magia, existem até 100 feitiços disponíveis no jogo. Os jogadores podem investir em diferentes tipos de feitiço (terra, fogo, etc.) e podem alternar entre eles a qualquer momento. Ela tem 4 tipos básicos de magia (Suporte, Corpo a Corpo, amarilha e tiro longa distância e por último super especial). Porem fica ressalvo, progresso árvores de habilidades é extremamente lento. Isso poderia ser um ponto negativo, por que te força a explorar o mapa para que possamos ter acesso a novas magias, fazendo alguns desafios.Gráfico / Desempenho (Excelente e Péssimo)Bom para começa excelente a relação dos gráficos cenários, e bastante detalhes que estão bonitos mesmo, ate vestimenta dos personagens NPC (Conselhos, reis, chefes) que tem uma partícula de detalhes muito interessante, até mesmo mapa/cenários estão muito bonitos rochas, águas, e as animações. Porém, a animação das expressões faciais dos personagens, percebemos que estão mal acabados, chega ser bem tosco isso, existem dois tipos de cena, uma cena gameplay narrativa e outra cena que parece filme que realmente estão bonitos demais.Legendado Pt-Br / Trilha sonora - Extremamente Excelente e regularTrilha sonora e muito boa mesmo, tanto com exploração e combate com muita excelente com adaptação trilha sonora gameplay. Agora tradução legendado, não gostei tanto assim algumas conversas com Frey Holland, exemplo Frey conversando com personagens e vez dizer sinto muito ou desculpa uma coisa nesse tipo, não e ela simplesmente fala “NOSSA QUE BOSTA” rsrsrs, tem umas traduções dialogo que ficou não ficou legal, e você vai perceber isso.Ponto positivoJogabilidade com uma mistura excelente Magia e parkour – Temos mais 100 tipos de magias que poderia aprimora árvores de habilidade, com várias magias elemental interessante. E o Parkour e muito divertido com essa toda velocidade indo exploração dos mapas.Exploração e Desafios missões secundárias – São muita coisa para fazer nesse mapa, temos dungeons, puzzle, mini boss, tesouro para recolher equipamento e poderes. E com isso mapa são extremamente enormes para explorar cada cantinho tem para oferecer, com cenários são bonitos.Ferramenta de acessibilidade controles – um dos pontos que mais gostei, é que você pode personalizar o menu, caso queria seja automático, até mesmo poderá controlar as dificuldades do game e inclusive poderá diminuir o dano recebido e também pode optar pela  esquiva automática. Ponto NegativoPrólogo de introdução e Lento – início gameplay e muito extremamente lento, levei quase 3hs e para ter acesso mapa, contendo bastante dialogo.Progresso evolução do personagem Frey Holland – um ponto que achei negativo foi evolução de acesso dos poderes ser lento, como é questão de força fazer as missões secundárias e campanha para ter acesso poderes.Animação expressão facial – tens uns certos personagens que são extremamente feios mesmo, mas ressaltando que não é todos, isso não estraga sua experiência com a jogabilidade.Game tem certa possibilidade de ser enjoativo – esse game tem certa probabilidade de enjoar, isso vai depender muito do estilo de jogatina de cada um. O jogo pode se tornar extremamente repetitivo e existem partes que são totalmente genéricas.Excesso documento de leitura – Meu deus, existem muitos diálogos para pode entendermos a história, isso se torna um ponto negativo se assim como eu, você também não tem paciência de ficar lendo e lendo e lendo. ConclusãoResumindo pergunta que fica, realmente vale a pena comprar? Ou devo espera a próxima promoção, ou esperar que eles lancem uma atualização para melhoria do jogo ! Ai voce que descidir",1,2,0.5

Игра ужасна во всех смыслах, это, вероятно, худшая халтура за многие годы. Начну с того, что бросается в глаза с первого взгляда: с графики. Она не просто плохая, она действительно ужасная. Это уровень игр 2014-15 годов, но никак не 2023 года. И ладно бы при такой графике она требовала бы столько же, сколько и они. Но нет, эту убогую игру еле вытягивают карты 40-ой серии... В некоторых областях фпс падает просто катастрофически. У меня не просто ощущение, нет, я знаю, и все мы знаем как факт, что в игре нет абсолютно никакой оптимизации. Даже намека на нее.Что у нас дальше? Ах да, сюжет...)) Сюжет))) Боже))) Будет невероятным комплиментом назвать ЭТО сюжетом) Абсолютно пустые и даже кринжевые диалоги, пустые персонажи, обилие стыдной повесточки, ну и вишенка на торте: неимоверно бесячий и тупой главный герой (геройка?), паталогический нытик и эгоистка с ужасным топорным чувством юмора, которая на всё реагирует неуместным матом. Сам сюжет до ужаса вторичный, а наратив просто смешон: вместо катсцен с диалогами, операторской съемкой и так далее — статичные стеклянные статуи людей, которые обмениваются звуковой информацией (речью я это назвать не могу), а игроку предлагают слушать всю эту тягомотину по несколько минут и так 15+ раз за игры. Мммм, класс (нет)Может быть весь этот ужас перевесит интересный геймплей?) Нет)) И здесь разработчики наделали в штаны: играть в это абсолютно неинтересно, карта пустая, нет никаких точек интереса, кроме ""лабиринтов"" формы прямой кишки, где в конце нас ожидают одни и те же соперники, нет адекватных сайдквестов и заданий, кроме как ""ыы пойди убей монстров где-то там/ыы а теперь убей чуть больше монстров, но вот там/ыыы вот тут на полу мана валяется, собери ее ыыы"", нет никакого желания изучать мир этой игры, он просто пустой, как и сама игра.Вердикт: провал года, пустая трата времени и денег, наглая халтура и тревожный звонок игровой индустрии.",1,2,0.5

Xplocion,http://www.metacritic.com/user/Xplocion,"Jan 25, 2023",3,Negative,"The good:A new Square-Enix game (not Final Fantasy Exploitation or any previous franchise). There is a demo that you can download first to see how the game is and save your money (if it's not for how bad the game is, they have already removed the demo) The bad:Excellent of mist, fog and smog to cover a lack. Textures are missing or fail to load for the environment.Very basic character modeling. The excrement color palette is back with a large number of greys, browns, ochre, olive green, navy blue… Painful drawing distance. In-game items crash (can be fixed with a patch). Mechanics recycled from other games like Babylons Fall, Tomb Rider Parkour and FFXV. Wide scenarios to try to give the idea of a lot of place to explore, but it is false because it is empty and there are no interesting things to do and when you want to get off the route that the game wants to show you, it returns you to the starting point of the route. This ""game"" costs money, it is not a demo or Early Access. The behavior of the enemies is painful and only ""activates"" in certain areas. Preview and introductory gameplay videos at previous years events are fake or CGIs The Meh!:When you see the Square-Enix demos known as ""Angis Philosophal"" or ""The Witch"" back in 2014-2016 the future seemed glorious and the textures and characters... but you see this game and you realize they were lying and didn't optimize nothing and they released a very poorly optimized and poorly polished game.

Ciudades vacias y sin chiste o vida, los npc's parecen de ps2 con movimientos totalmente roboticos y repetitivos, pero lo peor de todo es la ""niebla"" que se usa de una manera nefasta clara mente para ocultar cosas a la lejania y reducir la distancia de dibujado. La historia es sosa, nada que te enganche, personajes forzados a cumplir con ideoligias politicamente correctas que simplemente estan de sobra. La jugabilidad bastante regular, nada que no se haya visto en juegos como black desert(por ejemplo) que ya tienen bastantes años. Lo de combinar poderes y elementos es algo interesante pero se pierde totalmente cuando te enfrentas a enemigos con nula inteligencia.El parkour tambien es una idea buena pero mal ejecutada, juegos como spiderman o Dying light le dan 300 vueltas en mecanicas de movilidad, a eso le agregas que es un mundo vacio y se te quita el poco gusto que tenia la mecánica. La optimizacion es pesima, pero es algo que se puede mejorar, todo lo de mas no. Para mi, un fracaso total de Square y PS.

OnlyOneHere,http://www.metacritic.com/user/OnlyOneHere,"Jan 26, 2023",0,Negative,"This game is a huge steaming pile of garbage. The greedy developers are charging $70 for a next-gen only game that looks worse than cross-gen and even last gen games. The story is terrible. The protagonist is so annoying. The dialogue is cringeworthy and so are the running animations. The physics are beyond horrible. The gameplay is boring and repetitive. There is a lack of enemy variety. I couldn't even jump into a pond full of water, because these developers were too cheap to make swimming mechanics. In what world does a modern AAA open world game lack swimming mechanics? There is nothing to do in the open world. It's just an empty lifeless world full of plants, trees, rocks and a boring copied and pasted ancient looking city. I am sick to death of developers making the same open world games over and over again. It's always this empty landscape with a few ancient architectures and weird looking monsters. Where's the variety in AAA games? If I wanted this ancient civilization stuff, then I would go watch the History Channel. Oh that's right, even the History Channel understood that ancient civilization is boring, so they added reality shows like Pawn Stars for ratings. These developers need to cut down on this ancient civilization trash and leave that stuff to books. Speaking of ancient, it's no wonder why a fossil like GTA V currently outsells AAA games that were barely released last year. What else are people suppose to buy when these out of touch developers make the same boring and empty open world game with ancient civilization? You see that NYC section at the very start of the game? That's what I want to explore, but the developers were too cheap and lazy to make an open world game in an urban area. It's easier to copy/paste plants everywhere and use rural areas as an excuse for lack of NPCs. There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is literally not a reason to play this game again. Charging $70 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. Once again, is it a surprise why GTA V outsells newer games and will eventually outsell this trash before Summer or even Spring? What else are people suppose to buy when so many games have no multiplayer? Ancient civilization, empty worlds, no online, do video game developers not want to make any freaking money? Jesus Christ are these developers so out of touch. I can't even blame Rockstar for their laziness and re-releasing GTA V for the hundredth time. Why bother releasing GTA 6 when the rest of the developers are even lazier, to the point where they don't even want to compete against GTA 5.

11Anks,http://www.metacritic.com/user/11Anks,"Jan 27, 2023",0,Negative,"A very disappointing game in all respects - animation, art direction, cinematics, environment, mood, tone, dialogue, and story progression. The dialogue is the main highlight and seems to represent the nadir/lowest point of video games. Just even hard to imagine how the developers and the team of ""all-star"" writers could think that this game could be successful by any means. But this review is only for the developers and the writers and not the actor who voiced  Frey. Instead, I would like to commend Ella Balinska (the voice actor) for keeping up with and voicing the extremely unlikable and unsympathetic dialogue crafted by the developers and the team of ""all-star"" writers. Forspoken is a masterclass in how not to make video games. The developers should take lessons from A Plague Tale series, Red Dead Redemption series, God of War (2018 and Ragnarok), The Last of Us series, Halo series, and indie titles (Hollow Knight, Ori, Tunic, Stray, etc.) on constructing impactful video games.",3,7,0.42857142857142855

Nah but it has a fantastic story, a great cast of characters and if you actually interact with people, do the detours, get the archives and do activities the story REALLY fleshes out the host of characters that make Athia so memorable. If you race through the main story and do nothing else you’re limiting your entire experience to your own detriment. Combat is super fast pace, fun and dynamic. The amount of enemies and weak points makes for quick tactical changes during battle and keeps each encounter fresh. There’s some truly challenging boss fights (not story related) that make you work for your win. Some of the labyrinth bosses can be pretty insane too. There’s so many different ways to traverse the world and as you play the story and explore the map you find new spells frequently. There’s a lot of charm to the game as well like finding the Tanta’s familiars, chasing cats in Cipal and dancing in the pub. The gear and crafting options are abundant and really can be tailored to your approach to combat. There’s offensive, defensive, curative etc options that again, you’re only going to find by exploring the map and not just rushing through the story. I’m 60 hours in and doing post main story stuff and the game is still loads of fun with more detours and mutants and region bosses to take down. The uniqueness of the gameplay combined with the incredible storytelling (especially the super intense plot twisting crazy last half) make this one of the most memorable game experiences I’ve had in a long while. Give it a shot, Frey, Cuff & Athia definitely have and incredible story to tell.",2,5,0.4

As far as the gameplay after 15 hours or so maybe a bit less I felt as though I had got control of my character.   I thought when I pay through on max level in a month or two i will be right.  At 10 hours the story was just about there but very thin  The commentary was starting to grate just a little but was my sense of humour so i coped.  Everything went downhill from there.  The story became condensed with each boss kill  I began to think I was being rushed to the end.  The map was a nightmare to work with  I tried to do everything side quests etc but you had to search for them  The decision towards the end meant either the game was instant over or you continues on but after 20 hours i was done  Replayability none  So much money for 20 hours gameplay which at best was very poor I feel ripped off,2,5,0.4

The battles are varied with enemies immune to certain elements of magic, carrying shields, etc. The gameplay is very good. The world is full of things to explore - be it monuments, dungeons, towns, challenges and climbing tasks. The map is incredibly large and offers a lot. It took me about 10 hours to complete the first boss - and I didn't turn over every stone along the way. I can't quite understand the hate.

The side quests in the towns are kinda boring,  the ones in the open world are much better.  I have not been able to stop playing.   I just don't get the hate.  I gave a 10 to bump up the score but I would give it an 8.5.  Nothing below an 8.  If the writing was better I'd give it a 10.  But for the scenery,  the music and combat alone I think it deserves at least an 8.  And hey, it actually dropped on console without any major gamebreaking bugs.  That's rare these days.  I've experienced very little bugs or glitches, runs very smooth on ps5.  Haven't experienced anything close to gamebreaking bugs though.

cheeseman585,http://www.metacritic.com/user/cheeseman585,"Jan 25, 2023",8,Positive,"I'm not sure why this is getting review bombed.  It is as fun as any open-world exploration game like Assassin's Creed, but with a very fluid movement system and surprisingly deep combat.  Unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty, you'll likely breeze through most combat encounters after a few hours of exploration, but that means that there are legitimate rewards and reasons to go exploring and pick up everything.  The skill tree gives you a lot of choices, and the spellcraft system gives you a good reason to use everything and play around with abilities that you might not normally use. The story is different than a lot of stuff that you see, though still a little trope-y.  The voice lines get repetitive during combat and exploration, but at least you get a good sense of the relationship between the characters.  There's also interesting consequences for the actions that the player's character takes, with reasonable motivations and reactions.  It probably won't win any rewards, but it gives you good motivation to continue exploring and go through the story areas. If you're someone who enjoys exploring a world and doesn't want Dark Souls level challenges, then there's a good chance you will enjoy playing this game.",10,28,0.35714285714285715

Unfortunately though because of covid and what seemed to be just an idea that sparked from the tech demo and not alot of backing or time to fully grow it is a bit behind in the way of this gens offerings... thats not to say it isn't worth playing because it is fun and it's nice to have something original to get into.. once again ppl forget what gaming is all about these days but stleast playstation and square Enix still aren't afraid to take risks in their journey at finding or creating the future of gaming... you gotta appreciate evolution even when it doesn't always work out it atleast helps pave the way for the future... something other companies fail to achieve no matter how much money they have to throw at it...,6,17,0.35294117647058826
GamersPointe,http://www.metacritic.com/user/GamersPointe,"Jan 25, 2023",8,Positive,"This game is actually really good, and there are obvious tall tales being told by many other reviewers.  Since no one has to verify they've ever even played the game, they can come on here and say whatever they want about something they've never played.  I've never seen a more obvious fake review bombing in my life.  Just look at all the boiler plate arguments being made.  Same talking points in a bunch of ratings, and no one's questioning that lack of variation.  That's crazy to me. They say the graphics are mediocre but the environments are larger, more detailed, more populated, and more active than in Fortnite, Dauntless, and Bayonetta 3.  Proof of the falsehood of these claims is being posted all over Twitter; screenshots from the game itself.  There are even wildly false claims about the graphics being seriously downgraded.  That's not true.  It's stunning on PS5, and a quick trip to YouTube to watch actual PS5 gameplay proves that it looks great - overall better than Division 2, that's for sure.  Division 2 focuses on player characters, and the NPC's don't look so hot.  More attention was given to all of the characters in Forspoken than in that.  The dragon looks spectacular, and the special effects have far fewer flashing white screens than very many other titles, making it more epilepsy friendly without losing the magic of the visuals.  The closest justification they have is from grabbing stills from YouTube gamers using the lowest settings on budget PC's, or criticizing character models as if PERFECTLY recreating a real actress in modeling software is easy.  That's not an honest opinion, that's a bandwagon for the sake of hating a game that they already chose to hate well before its launch. They say the dialogue and voice acting are bad, but they gave Bayonetta 3 rave reviews despite it sounding much worse, and they say the narrative is typical or mediocre while applauding other titles that simply RETELL PRE-EXISTING STORIES WITH THE ONLY CHANGE BEING THE INSERTION OF A NEW CHARACTER [GoW] - and even games that have no story at all [Smash].  Some, like Batman, don't even introduce new characters when retelling the exact same story.  The combat banter, explorative chatter, and cinematic narrative are all solid.  Lots of references to Marvel movies, but the story is actually more closely related to Alice In Wonderland and Magicians [both applauded for their narratives, and the former is even referenced] -_- Most people making these arguments actually NEVER played the game because they would know that otherwise.  Mario is typical; Forspoken isn't typical at all.  It's not cringe Identitarian woke nonsense either, some just don't like that the lead and heroine is a racial minority who was a troubled youth.  You can even see these biases in reviews ON HERE for Spider-Man: Miles Morales.  Similar complaints, more forgiving ratings for the classic franchise despite the same prejudices.  KH3 keeps telling the same story in new locations; rave reviews.  Forspoken drops an urban adult orphan who was previously trapped in a bad and realistic situation into an Isekai modeled after GoT-like fantasy worlds [yes, there are poor people living in ghettos in the modern REAL world], gives her magical abilities, challenges her to survive in an environment that she's never experienced the parallel of, and forces her to solve a mystery around very powerful people just so that she can return home to continue her life; considered typical.  How is that cookie cutter?  Platform envy can make people adorably childish. The combat in this is richer, more varied, and more creative than in that of Hades; Hades gets rave reviews and Forspoken gets review bombed.  What's the difference?  Exclusivity.  That's interesting, isn't it?  Hades has different effects applied to the same limited move set of each of the only six standard weapons.  It's extremely limited in combat variety.  Forspoken has advanced movement mechanics [a cross between AC and Spider-Man], a host of different spells that ALL have different animations, a solid unlock and upgrade tree, two styles of combat to approach different situations within the same character, a mix of adds that often requires switching between combat styles, third-person shooter mechanics that use magic instead of bullets [in the spirit of Uncharted], and over-the-shoulder melee mechanics [in the spirt of GoW].  She can even continue fighting while using her parkour movements.  Player controlled attacks in the middle of flips?  That's not common. There are so many double standards used in the negative reviews of this game, and there's even more dishonesty.  Don't let haters yank your chain simply because they didn't get the game on their preferred platform, and don't let polarizing critics do it either.  Profiting off of hot takes and hyperbole are the norm now, so challenge them by trying the demo.  You just might like it.",8,23,0.34782608695652173

O universo do jogo é muito abrangente tendo extremos desafios, porem ele não te recompensa o suficiente para aprofundar, um detalhe bem marcante que entrega muito bem é o detalhe da história isso é o ponto forte do jogo, os detalhes minuciosamente descritos para as áreas que Frey vem a descobrir e destravar é um ponto interessante. A Gameplay acaba por ser repetitiva como todo jogo, mas não chata, a personagem principal ao decorrer da história nós apegamos a ela nos sentimos indiferentes, as vezes com raiva e até mesmo nos solidarizamos. Com o decorrer dos fatos é levemente previsível de previnir o que pode ser o desfecho final da campanha principal, porem não deixa de impactar bastante, por conta dessa mistura de sentimentos que temos em relação a protagonista. Eu diria que Forspoken é um jogo que no fim ele não vai marcar gerações e revolucionar a indústria dos games, como a maioria dos jogos atuais, porem ele pode pelo menos descansar sabendo que é um bom jogo.Obs: alguns pontos muito interessantes que o jogo abrange de forma mesmo que sútil são problemas de autoconfiança, depressão / suicídio entre muitos temas que a protagonista meio que vai se descobrindo com o tempo.Obs 2: O jogo tem uma temática muito parecida com alice no pais das maravilhas, e tem inclusive um livro de história mencionado em duas partes da gameplay, mas o que mais me chamou a atenção foi a parte da trilha sonora que é praticamente idêntica a de alice e até os visuais e ambientação de alguns lugares.",7,21,0.3333333333333333

Playing $70 on a trash game that pretty much every gaming news outlet has pretty much pooped on is ridiculous. So, I did. Pop it in the PS5, started it up and played it about 6hrs and another 7hrs the next day.  And I'm puzzled. Graphics are good, music is good, a lot to explore in the world. I enjoyed the combat, slow at first like most games. Gotta keep playing and exploring to get stronger, like most games. I like the story so far. I like reading about the history and the people of Athia. For me it gets an 8. Playing it, I didn't have any issues pop up. Sure, I can nick pick about small issues, like talking to npc you have to stand right in front of them to engage in conversation. Some games you can stand on the side of them, and they would turn and face you. Frey and cuff do repeat dialog in the open world. Not the first game a played that had this issues. The thing is you can go into option and change how much they interact with each other in the world. I remember playing cyberpunk 2077. Came out on PS4 but was playing it on my PS5. What a buggy mess. Game crash so many times. Had the director apologizing for a buggy game. PlayStation issuing refunds and took it off the store page. So many updates to get it working right. IGN give it a 9 out of 10. I could go on and on about cyberpunk 2077, about the graphics, the menu, the map. Story was good but could never finish it. I give cyberpunk a 6 out of 10. With good reason. Forspoken doesn't really do anything new that we haven't seen before. Hard to find games that do that anymore. But it's playable. I Know, everyone has there on opinions, and I respect that. It's hard reading review about games nowadays. I wonder how many fake reviews they are on here just to drive the score down.

Yes, Cuff is a little annoying, but he's also designed to be that way. The back and forth between Frey and him actually grew on me. Many of those ""cringe"" comments seem to take dialogue lines out of context. I also really like the fact that there is a female afro-american protagonist and an ethnically diverse cast and the game DOESN'T make a big thing out of it - it's just the way it is, and that's about it. Graphically, the game unfortunately doesn't look as great as in the ""Project Athia"" announcement trailer, but I already knew that from the demo. It still looks nice though. Gameplay wise, the parcour and combat systems are really well designed and the world is built as a playground for those features. Forspoken certainly won't be my ""Game of the Year 2023"", but it doesn't deserve all that hate either.

I don't know what others were expecting but I think it's telling that most criticism is levied at the dialogue. It shows how solid the rest of the game is when the review bombers go after something so minor.",3,9,0.3333333333333333
nishfish92,http://www.metacritic.com/user/nishfish92,"Jan 27, 2023",8,Positive,"The game itself is really good. The critics out there are correct in their assessment but the impact itself is overblown. While the game does have a few issues they don't really deter one from the game and gameplay. No issues with the performance of the game at all. The graphics aren't splendid like Forbidden West but still good. We are just spoilt by constant perfection that one wouldn't even notice if not educated enough. For me, the game looks splendid unless an expert pointed out the issues specifically. People forget about Cyberpunk 2077. Also, regarding a game that was bashed for no reason refer to ""DAYS GONE"". Sometimes people just don't know what they dislike. Also, shoutout to Ella Balinska.

Players have reported instances where the game would randomly freeze or crash, causing them to lose progress and restart from an earlier point. These glitches are especially prevalent during fast-paced, high-stress moments in the game, leading to frustration and annoyance. Another common issue with the game is the presence of visual and audio glitches. Characters might suddenly disappear or appear in strange places, and audio cues may not match the on-screen action. This can cause confusion and disorientation for players, making it difficult to accurately assess the situation and respond appropriately. The glitches in the game are not limited to just the visual and audio components. Gameplay mechanics are also affected, with players reporting issues with hit detection, collision detection, and other critical elements. These issues make it difficult for players to control their characters and progress through the game, as they often find themselves at the mercy of the game's unpredictable and faulty programming. The game is widely considered to be plagued by an excessive number of glitches that negatively impact the player experience. Whether it's the frequent crashes, visual and audio anomalies, or faulty gameplay mechanics, these glitches make it difficult for players to fully enjoy the game and its features. As a result, many players have expressed disappointment and frustration with the game and its developers, who have yet to provide a satisfactory solution to these ongoing issues.",1,3,0.3333333333333333

Talán a Sony exkluzív Returnalhoz hasonlítani lehetne Frey varázs képességeivel való gyors harcot. A játék,nagyon pörgős és élvezetes harcrendszerrel,nem erős történettel,kicsit túl zoomer és nagy szájú tini fő karakterrel látták el. A játék története alatt elérhető képességek látványával dominálva akar minket a képernyő elé ragasztani. A fejlődési lehetőséggel eleinte lassan érhetők el a képességek ,ami kicsit eltántoríthatja a játékost. Bár ha kitartunk ,akkor viszont nagyon sok kombó lehetőség áll elénk, ami színesebbé és még élvezetesebbé teszi a harcot és annak látványát. A harcok közben lévő animációk precizek ,folyékonyak. A gondosan finomhangolt parkour ugrások,kitérések is szintén a legjobb latványt nyújtják. Az átvezető videók animaciói középszerűek viszont jól néznek ki. Néhol van olyan textúra ami nem elég kidolgozott a világba. A map hatalmas és néhol üres lehet. Viszont a történet és annak világa indokolja az élettelen tájakat. Dimbes-dombos ,hegyes füves kopár elhagyatott,néhol zord tájak váltják egymást. Nagyon sok mindent lehet tenni a térképen. Fejleszteni statot,macskákat lehet elkapni, ,ruhákat és nyakláncokat feloldani,fejlesztéshez és craftoláshoz való anyagokat gyüjtögetni ,ládákat kifosztani és olyan materiákat szerezni,amik elég könnyen feloldható puzzle ládákhoz vannak kötve. Minden biomhoz legalább 2 ládát őrző mutáns boss van amik sok esetbe nehezebbek vagy veled együtt fejlettek. Vannak labirintusnak nevezett helyek ahol a vegéig vezető úton szobakba enemyk majd a végén egy boss van. Minden elért képességet tudunk durvára fejleszteni a safe houseokba, miután megkapjuk az elérhetőségét. Ezek amolyan harc alatti challengekhez vannak kötve. Összessegében a játék jó de nem tökéletes.

LowercaseGee,http://www.metacritic.com/user/LowercaseGee,"Jan 28, 2023",10,Positive,"Forspoken has actually made it in to my top 10 of all time. I know the response to it has been poor for the most part, but I genuinely enjoyed the vast majority of my time in Athia and am glad I ignored all the negativity leading up to its release. 2 qualifiers: 1.) I absolutely hate open world games with silent protagonists, so I actually enjoyed Frey and Cuff’s back and forth. I turned the banter frequency to high and didn’t mind when lines would repeat since it was something to keep me company while I was out exploring. 2.) I also don’t hate “Whedon-esque” or “Marvel” (or whatever other super fun and original label you want to slap on it) style dialogue, so I was entertained by the quips and quirks throughout the game’s events. There isn’t any particular line or interaction that felt out of place given the circumstances. A lot of interactions left me with a goofy grin on my face. I can see how the animations aren’t anything groundbreaking or special, but they’re far from terrible. A handful of sequences were breathtaking and the only real complaint was the faces being stiff outside of cutscenes. That’s not really something that I take points off for though, given how much I enjoyed the story and gameplay everywhere else, so YMMV. There was nothing at all wrong with the gameplay. I felt the damage scaled appropriately as you went though the story, and upgrading your spells wasn’t a grind since you could easily refund your points to reallocate them as you felt like it. The quests you take to upgrade the spells further all felt fair. Traversal and pulling off combos were both massively satisfying. I only had one crash after I had played the game for about 8 hours straight. It happened during a cutscene toward the end, and when I reloaded it played through just fine. Overall, I enjoyed my experience with Forspoken a lot and am hoping to see more of this world and its characters. I loved that Frey was her own person, even if that meant going against what you, as the player, thought she should want to do or how she should act. Not that she wasn’t relatable, there were a lot of times I’d find myself commenting on the game and not long after Frey would say something very similar. I can’t say anything for or about the people that hate it so much, I can only say how much I loved it. A character-driven narrative with snarky one-liners and a companion that helps keep off the lonely feeling that creeps in when I play open worlds, with plenty of space to run (and jump and flip and throw **** with your mind.)

The map is huge and underutilized during the story, leaving the player with many post-endgame challenges.Surely the graphics would need to be improved to consider it a NEXT Gen, some imperfections are not acceptable in 2023. Personally I think the game gets bombarded with negative reviews because it's a game with a strong female imprint. There are no male characters, the main hero is a strong woman with a bad mouth that not everyone appreciates. It will not be a title to be replayed but it certainly deserves a 75.",1,3,0.3333333333333333
Lapinal,http://www.metacritic.com/user/Lapinal,"Feb  1, 2023",0,Negative,"The two commercial main arguments for this game were ""the graphics are Amazing that's why we wouldn't make it on PS4"" and ""The gameplay is insane!"".It turns out both are trash. The graphics in the trailer are nothing like the final result. The sky is in jpeg format, the animations are backwards, and most PNJs are not even fully animated.The gameplay is simple: You just spam R2 and L2.And oh my god the dialogues are so cringe. Frey and the cuffs just can't shut up. Whenever they talk it's like a competition of who's going to make the snarkiest remark. The main character is unlikable, she swears all the time, it's like a child when they learn a bad word for the first time and then use it on every occasion.I saw that the writing team was american which explains a lot.

TheArt_Fiend,http://www.metacritic.com/user/TheArt_Fiend,"Jan 26, 2023",8,Positive,"Just over 10hrs in and I’m enjoying the game immensely, good fluid traversal, combat is ok takes a while to get the hang of switching between spells but it didn’t take me long to get used to it once the muscle memory kicked in. The story is a take on the classic Alice In Wonderland story but adding a modern twist, Freya is a orphaned girl from Hells Kitchen, New York who gets transported to a mysterious world Atheia and is trying to get back home to Earth by trying to navigate the laws and politics of this new world while also trying to uncover the source of a mysterious corruption that has blighted the world of Aethia which she has dubbed The Break, while on the other hand reflecting on the bad decisions she has made in her life thus far, this in turn drives her to make something of herself in her tumultuous time in Atheia. Dialogue is a hit or miss some of the interaction between Freya and her metal companion Cuff can be funny at times but they can be a little excessive the more the game progresses, graphics are ok but compared to games like Horizon: Forbidden West & God Of War: Ragnarok the game falls short. Performance wise I’m currently playing the game in performance focused mode and I’m using the 120hz mode as I have a LGC1 that supports this and I can say with out a doubt it feels buttery smooth when traversing with Freya around huge mountains ranges and the open fields of Aethia, frames dip silently when in combat when using spells but it is nothing that hinders the overall gameplay. Overall Forspoken is shaping up to being a great experience for me and I’m glad I picked it up despite the negative backlash it seems to be receiving on social media.

Noirex,http://www.metacritic.com/user/Noirex,"Jan 27, 2023",9,Positive,"Great game, would highly recommend. The game takes a while to open up a bit and after chapter 4, then can you only see truly how big the game world is. I really liked the combat and movement, it feels really fast paced or you can do a slower playstyle by choosing different spells. Parkour is really fun as well, it gave me the same vibes when swinging in Marvels Spider-Man.Graphics wise, it looked great to me on the PS5, running it it on performance option. Loading is very fast specially when fast travelling and hardly had any loading issues or glitches. There was only one scene during a detour quest that the frame froze for a second but haven't seen anything since.To address about the writing and dialogue, yes it is a little cringy but you get used to it. With all the complaints about the MC being insufferable, it actually helped to have a different perspective and consider the MCs background and how she grew up. I am personally looking forward to see how her character develops and I can already see a slight change and development early on after a certain event. The cutscenes can sometimes take you out of the immersion however specially if you played God of War Ragnarok recently as the gameplay and cutscenes for that game blends really well.If you like open world games with RPG elements, upgrading gears and skills, fluid combat and fun traversal, would recommend to give it a go.

They can say how bad it is, how it isn’t worth the money, how cringe the dialogue is.

JeeTurtle,http://www.metacritic.com/user/JeeTurtle,"Jan 26, 2023",8,Positive,"Im gonna do something crazy and review a game that i've actually played more than an hour of.Just finished Forspoken. It is not the most well put together game, and i suppose its easy to bounce off of, if you dont plan on sticking it out. But its definitely way better designed than its initial reception implies.The roughest parts in my opinion are the opening and ending.In between there is a game that feels a blend of typical late 2000s open world gaming, with Infamous style power fantasy and the Spiderman style ""game-of-movement"". The story gets going probably 2-3hours later, and from there you fall into a gameplay loop of maneuvering through the world over hills and up cliffs picking out a path based on movement abilities which get better as the game goes on (with hidden abilities that can be found out in the world to unlock). Note for myself setting magic parkour to toggle which made movement feel better* In addition there are tons of accessibility options to make the gameplay feel as close to comfort as possible - the devs took alot of care clearly in polishing out the little details, and my favorite detailin a game to date is being able to dash into loot boxes/doors and hit interact to skip the animation with a flourish.Movement aside, there is a power fantasy to the combat of Forspoken which also borrows Devil May Cry's rating system. When combat starts you have a rating from E to S which goes up from doing things like using parkour in combat and hitting weakness, but goes down when you take damage. Getting high rating gives you better loot (for crafting/upgrades) and more experience. Magic itself is split into offensive, support and surge/ultimate. Offensive spells can be combod and holding right trigger will use or charge the offensive spell. Using combos and weaving in support spells will quick charge offensive magic. Using both will charge Surge magic which is pure spectacle. Essentially you find yourself flipping between support spells and eventually other magic styles, to build your style meter, also performing counters which can restore health, lethal attacks on down enemies, etc. Magic styles can be upgraded by using mana collected on the open world and levelling up. Each spell can also be enhanced by completing challenges during combat. The downside of this is the magic styles are unlocked on story beats and the first one can take around 6 hours to unlock, my favorite style didnt unlock until the end of the game essentially. The good news is there is still more to dow in between and after the main story. Each ""Detour"" on the map either unlocks gear (with enhancements and cosmetic change),stats or gives lore which is kept in the extensive game archive(the archive has alot of story about the world of Athia). You really do miss out on alot of the fun if you just rush from story beat to beat, and probably will make the game harder than it needs to be.Not much to say about crafting, but it is nice that you can put whatever enhancements on whatever gear as well as uograde the stats. You collect loot for crafting pretty much wherever you go.The story itself worked for me. I think the perspective of the main character is valid, and where she ends up feels pretty natural. The big moments of the story felt impactful especially the twist towards the end. Not gonna say much more about this, its a story we dont see alot more of in gaming. Its unfortunate that marketing couldnt figure out how to present it, but thats not indicative of the writing or the characters most of which i cared about by final credits.Also the world is empty but pretty dang beautiful.Good game overall, there are things to criticize, like weird pacing at the beginning, cutscenes taking control sometimes along with fade to black, and a couple of boss battles that made me play a bit weirdly. The worst offender to me is honestly the bird enemies but that is mostly one section of the game.Anyway, hope the review helps and you give this game a fair try if your interested.",2,7,0.2857142857142857

moht,http://www.metacritic.com/user/moht,"Jan 26, 2023",8,Positive,"Overall, really not as bad as the memes would have you believe. Some people carry on like the game itself shot their grandmother and shat on their dog, and a bunch of other people jumped on that bandwagon because they're too lazy to think for themselves and wanna board a hate train because they have nothing better to do with their lives.Is this the best game I've ever played? Absolutely not. But it's one of very few games where combat and travel was throughly engaging all the way through and not just the same old boring slog between cutscenes and major boss fights. The quips the main two make to each other were, for the most part, funny and realistic and something I very much enjoyed. And let's be honest, there are plenty of games out there that have much cringier dialog but are still beloved (looking at you Mr. Dante ""I SHOULD'VE BEEN THE ONE TO FILL YOUR DARK SOUL WITH LIIIIGHT"" Devilmaycry). However, the main problem I have with the dialog isn't the quality, but the quantity; even before I hit the first boss the two main characters were already cycling through overworld conversations they'd already had, and I had the Cuff interaction setting on default the entire time. I just wish there had been more variety there, since it was clear their interactions were going to be an important and prominent part of the audio landscape in the overworld.If I have a major gripe about the game, it seems clear to me that while the combat and magic parkour system were obviously top priority for the devs to master (and was, in my opinion, absolutely nailed) a lot of other things could have used more time and resources to give it that extra polish. Animations for side characters and social interactions in general are serviceable, but there's a clear difference of quality between them and the stellar combat/movement animations. It gives the game an overall feel that its brimming with potential but was not given enough time and resources to truly shine.Something I consider both a pro and a con would be the overworld and how desolate it looks. It makes the world feel empty, sure, but once I had the context that this world recently underwent an apocalypse that decimated literally 99% of its population and trapped the remaining 1% in a central hub that was the only place free of contamination, I find that emptiness actually adds to my immersion in the world and makes me feel the loss of it's life and people that much more keenly. I could also very much see that being written into the world AFTER it was clear they didn't have the resources to populate the rest of the world outside the one NPC hub, but given that in the end it adds to my immersion and could be a somewhat clever workaround for a lack of resources, I consider it both a plus and a minus to the experience. Take from that what you will.As for bugs: I've encountered 2 noticeable bugs so far, one being that while in a building near the beginning of the game the outside world looks like a bright white void, and one other instance where a solider had clipped through the ground. Both of which are quickly solved, the first just by going outside and letting my camera adjust to the difference in lighting, and the second by shooting at the ground where the enemy was to push him back up through the ground. Neither of which were game breaking in any way, but I felt they were worth mentioning.One other thing I will mention that's less an issue with this game specifically and more a commentary on the AAA gaming industry that's trying to make this a Thing, but I was really not a fan of the price tag. As a Canadian, the standard edition of this game (with tax) came to just over $100. Despite being an enjoyable experience that I would otherwise recommend to people who enjoy dynamic, fluid combat and fun isekai power fantasies, I would not say that this game is worth $100. To be fair, there are very, VERY few games that I would say ARE worth that much, and as such I do not fault this game specifically for that, but rather an industry that keeps arbitrarily pushing their prices up every few years or so.So, in summary:- fun, fluid, dynamic combat and travel abilities that are solidily made and engaging throughout the whole experience- humorous and realistic dialog that some will like and others will hate; it's up to your own sense of humor in the end, but I personally found it enjoyable- lacking in polish when it comes to anything other than the combat/magic parkour animations; the brunt of the resources clearly went to mastering combat/movement- open, desolate world that both adds to the immersion but does not make for a typically pleasing aesthetic- minimal bugs and none of them game breaking, which is sadly saying a lot for AAA games these days- overall, not worth the $100+ (CDN) price tag, but not very many games are, and as such would definitely recommend this for fans of isekais and engaging combat only after the price has dropped a bit",2,7,0.2857142857142857

Wasting time in exploring open word, while do the magic parkour is fun. Many newest things player could find while exploring, in addition the open world is not empty.

The graphics we’re actually really good I was super impressed with how well it ran on my PS5. However the game fails to hit the mark on pretty much anything and everything. The side quests we’re so bland and boring , just your typical chores I couldn’t do anymore after 2 so who knows maybe they got better after that? I cannot stand Frey as a character , she is literally a horrible person thorough and though to the very end. No seriously I thought at the end by the last couple chapters she would have some kind of character development but she has 0 redemption I kid you not… I remember in the 2nd to last chapter I believe she has a friend who’s father was just killed and she tells her “She doesn’t give a sh** if her world burns” and she does not feel one shred of remorse. The entire game there is practically no consequences to her horrible actions at all. And when I say she’s a horrible character I am not exaggerating a single bit , every time something bad happened she was like “you you you” then whenever anything good happened she was like “me me me”",2,7,0.2857142857142857

Alstro56_gaming,http://www.metacritic.com/user/Alstro56_gaming,"Jan 27, 2023",8,Positive,"The game isn't terrible the reviews I'm seeing are actually the most confusing. On the worst end of the spectrum, I'm seeing 0/10 reviews where people say the game is terrible cause the main character is ""ugly"" but they really mean that they don't like that a black woman is the main character. In the middle of the spectrum, I see people say that the game doesn't meet expectations but I offer a counterargument. The game wasn't originally going to be a game we all knew this and then Square Enix saw the popularity and shifted focus, there's always been uncertainty about the game before its release but nobody believed it was going to be a standout game. Not to mention that they released a free demo months before release where everyone spoke their opinion which was negative at worst and mixed at best. This all leads to my review of the game as someone who owns and played over 4800+ games in the last 20 years. Forspoken is a B- game, There are qualities in this game that I enjoy more than 7/10 games (for me a 7/10 game is a game that has qualities of a bad game but does them in an okay way, such as Soul Hackers 2 or Saints Row, and don't achieve to make anything else good). Forspoken does well at music, performance/graphics, and gameplay (magic, dodging, and movement). Forspoken does okay at voice acting and the story is nothing special but I've seen plenty of games with better reviews have worse writing. (I'm still playing but I've enjoyed most of the scenes that some people have been hating on). Forspoken does terribly at animations, it's like they gave up sometimes.The one element I can't comment on is the open world, like spider-man the movement gives it bonus points but I haven't played enough to know if the game has enough variety in the world yet. Lastly, there are a few things people can do in the settings to improve the game, for example, support spells have cool-downs, but if you go into your options you can make it so the game will auto-switch to a support spell that is ready after you use a support spell, this allows combat to be quick cause you don't have to switch your support spell all the time. I also turned on auto-pick-up cause there are a lot of resources on the ground in this game and it's a lot more fun not pressing triangle 100 times per hour for rock A, rock B, rock C, etc. Forspoken is a barely 8/10 game, worth $40 to $60. I feel weird that anybody would complain about $70 price tag though cause the demo is still available for free. I feel at that point it was on you to decide whether you wanted the game to be worth $70.",6,24,0.25

LucianoKiller,http://www.metacritic.com/user/LucianoKiller,"Jan 26, 2023",8,Positive,"O jogo é muito bom.Totalmente diferente do que dizem.A história é boa e bem detalhada,quem criticou provavelmente não leu os inúmeros documentos que há no game.Na minha experiência não tive um bug sequer ( diferente de God of War Ragnarok q tive 4 e Horizon Forbiden West). Pontos positivos :História ( Se você ler todos os documentos) Efeitos de luz e magia. Trilha sonora. Habilidades da personagem. O jogo próximo do fim se tornar exatamente divertido. Agora os pontos negativos são o Parkour segurando ⭕ pois torna as batalhas fáceis. Um simples nerf em Frey resolveria o problema. E o segundo problema é a jogabilidade. A mira falha muito e atrapalha demais no início do game. Há atrasos nos comandos. Acredito que possa ser corrigido em um patch futuro. O gráfico é ok. Algumas paisagens são belíssimas (recomendo o modo quality mesmo a 30fps) A modelagem de alguns personagens tem menor Capricho que outros.

But it is still a good game, nonetheless. Do not listen to these pariahs who COMPLAIN about every existing thing, these guys promote themselves by being negative about literally everything.

GrungePunk,http://www.metacritic.com/user/GrungePunk,"Jan 28, 2023",10,Positive,After playing the demo I was on the fence about the game. Playing any game with no context or narrative is never a good way to judge a game. I gave the game a chance and bought it. Ended up pouring 30 hours into it and finishing it. The game itself was actually pretty fun and entertaining. Definitely could feel the Final Fantasy XV design in the way the game played. It almost felt like a spiritual successor to Final Fantasy XV with a little Spider-Man gameplay thrown into the mix. The story was decent and the ending was actually pretty cool and was probably the highlight. The game is by no means a perfect masterpiece but it's definitely a fun and enjoyable experience. It probably would have been received better if it was cheaper but in today's economy dropping almost a hundred bucks on a game that's not a masterpiece is a hard sell for some people. Game was polished and I ran into very few bugs. One of the few bugs I did experience was that after being in rest mode and trying to fast travel the game would lock up on a black loading screen and I would have to close the game and relaunch it. The autosave system prevented me from losing progress the few times it happened though. Combat and traversal mechanics are a lot of fun but not very challenging on the Normal difficulty especially when you start to level up the stats on your gear. Also the map is huge. Even after beating the game there are entire areas left to explore as after game content some of which unlock during after game side quests. It's worth picking up if you can spend the $70 on a decently fun game and not have buyer's remorse because it isn't some grandiose epic of storytelling. If you're strapped for cash though you're probably better off waiting for a sale and saving your money for Hogwarts Legacy or Dead Space right now.On a side note you get to collect adorable looking cat familiars and buy toys for them to play with. The enemies all have certain magic types that they are weak against and ones they are resistant against so as you play you start to memorize which attacks work best like a Pokémon match up. Game is a solid 7/10 but I felt the need to give it a 10 just to offset all the 0/10 reviews from people bombing it that didn't even bother playing it. The game's quality is on par with Days Gone which also received mixed reviews and a less than stellar reception when it came out. After beating Forspoken I had this huge urge to play Final Fantasy XV so I downloaded it and started a New Game to scratch more of that Forspoken itch because I wanted more.,1,4,0.25

It’s world is fascinating both visually and narratively, the dialog is NOT anywhere close to as bad as people say, in fact it’s often charming and funny. The gameplay is smooth, fast and fun, and the nature of the combat and traversal systems (tied with accessibility options) means you can play this as a high stakes straight up action game, focusing only on the main campaign, or spend significantly more time exploring the world, like a longer adventure/rpg.

Just so corny and cringe. The scene where she just constantly repeats ""I just moved sh*t with my mind"" and then the bracelet keeps reminding her that he technically done it  is exactly something you would hear from A new Marvel movie. Not only is the dialogue abysmal but the game play is just so boring. I bought this game expecting it to be bad but f**king hell. And the worse part is that it isn't similar to games like WWE2k20 or Saints row 5 where the game is so bad that it's funny. It's just bad in general. The only two positives I could say about this game is 1. The addition of Auto pick-up and 2. The traversal (at times) can be... uplifting. Forspoken is simply just another cash grab made by scummy developers who don't care.

Frey is truly a solid lead acted very well. The boss fights and especially the hidden boss fights all feel different and are a joy to play. The leveling and different types of magic make the combat feel fresh and fun. If you’re a puzzle fan there are some great slide puzzles that can be a fun side adventure. Solid side quests that can keep you busy in the large event driven open world with so much to do. I played in Ray Tracing mode on my PS5 and all of the experience was amazing.

Friendzie,http://www.metacritic.com/user/Friendzie,"Feb 22, 2023",7,Mixed,"Not that all negative reviews aren't legitimate, but it's sad to see this game partially review bombed because it's ""woke"" - in other words, because it has a female lead who's black. There is nothing political going on in this game, so I can't see what would be woke about it. The game's shortcomings are much more mundane. The open world design is not very interesting, and the writing misses the mark a lot of the time. It's not that it's necessarily bad writing, but the game's premise is already hard to take seriously as it is. This is made worse by the characters themselves constantly making light of everything. Is this a comedy or am I supposed to care about this place? Your parkour abilities are too strong, so the landscape barely matters unless they put massive cliffs everywhere to block you, which they do. You might feel like exploring once you get through the intro, but good luck with the dozens of massive cliffs funneling you to where you are supposed to go instead. What you can find often just turns out to be a health potion in a chest, though. As for what's good, well, the combat is alright, the spells are alright, the graphics are decent, and the faces look good. It runs well on the PS5. The accessibility and difficulty options are vast. The game's issues are pretty common in these sorts of games, so I really can't say it's a complete disaster of a game. They haven't reinvented the genre, nor have they solved its most pressing issues. If you never played an open world style RPG before maybe you wouldn't mind.",0,1,0.0

indieinsights,http://www.metacritic.com/user/indieinsights,"Feb 18, 2023",5,Mixed,"I appreciate the effort but a few bad director's issues: The main character is unlikeable. She is a thief, not an troubled-yet-good-heart underdog; just a thief that did not do anything in her past, without any special skills. That is lazy writing, not knowing how to write a likeable underdog thief. The enemies are mostly badly designed. The game spams you with effects, but sometimes it is hard to see what the actual enemies are doing, unless you watch the indicators: that is completely different to, say, Elden Ring or Horizon Zero Dawn. The movement and control behaviour is not as good as in other games, sometimes clunky. The cities feel stiff, unimaginative, dead sometimes, with NPCs standing around, doing weird or no things. I believe that the biggest issue is probably the unlikable main character... The writers messed this up. Think Darkpool: not exactly a good hero, doing sometimes horrible things, yet somehow the writers managed to make him likeable.

Snake_Pride,http://www.metacritic.com/user/Snake_Pride,"Jan 31, 2023",4,Negative,"I bought this game at the very start for all 70 dollars. To be honest, after a couple of hours, when the prologue finally ended and I was allowed to play freely, I realized that I would not give even 40, and after another couple of hours of mournful grinding in a completely empty open world, I lowered the bar to 25-30.This game feels very, very underdeveloped. The only thing here is a competent combat system. Attention, I'm not saying that she's good, she's just that competent. From the AAA project, I expected more than a parody of InFamous with cooldown skills that need to be developed by going through literally thousands of identical events to destroy magical mutants. The parkour was pretty good as part of the combat system, but again, give me more than running, jumping, dashing and grappling - it's in any reasonably advanced game. Although the animations are not bad, yes, but it is spoiled by the horrendous graphics, by the way.For starters, let's get some decent graphics: I don't want to point fingers, but Final Fantasy 15, made over 7 years ago, has better graphics and lower hardware requirements. I understand that the fear that the game will be hacked faster than it is released is justified, but let's be honest, now game developers have lost more from unsold copies than from pirated ones.Secondly, give events that will not be associated with the extermination of the fauna of the infected world: yes, at least a damn escort mission! I'm tired of running around the empty world from point to point, collecting mana and resources - is this a AAA project or a grind simulator?Finally, give me the opportunity to customize the character: it's not even about whether I'm a hidden chauvinist or not, I just don't like Frey's personality, neither at the end of the game, nor even at the beginning - it smacks too much of low-grade teenage women's novels for "" girls who are not like everyone else."" If I were given the opportunity to influence the plot of the game more than the choice of the order of questions asked by Frey, then I would be a little less unhappy. I understand that it seems to the big bosses that ""being progressive and standing up for the rights of аfrican аmericans and women, and even more so аfrican аmerican women, is fashionable"", but I remind you that the gaming audience is still only 30% of them. You are shooting yourself in the foot, dear developers.On this I would like to finish, I give the game 3 points for attempting the magic system, well, I will add a point for parkour.

TiltedTrickste,http://www.metacritic.com/user/TiltedTrickste,"Feb 11, 2023",9,Positive,"Tldr: low expectations, very pleasantly surprised, fantastic combat, world class movement (magic parkour), gripping story with very real and relatable characters. P.s. don't try to obtain every treasure chest (purple dots on the map). So good I was questioning whether I should buy Hogwarts as I was worried it would be a disappointment after playing this.I'm honestly shocked this game has such a low user rating score, but I guess I forget how much people enjoy to hate on new things. After playing the demo, I knew I would enjoy this game, but I had relatively low expectations. As someone who has been playing video games for the last 20 years I've found it hard to find a good game that keeps me interested all the way through.I was pleasantly surprised on how diverse the spells are, how many spells there are, how much content there is, and I was genuinely interested in the characters and story.I want to rank this a 10 to offer the haters, but realistically the game isn't perfect. I feel it's fair to say the game does everything well but could do better in various areas. I think some people don't love the New York Slums personality the main character has. I think people also might struggle to get used to the magic system. Then people also complain about the world being closed off.I genuinely really liked the main character and story, and this is where I felt the game would fall short in the demo. The main character is very real and relatable. She's not just some blank slate hero garbage like we typically see. While the magic system did take time to get used to, once you get a feel for it, it's extremely fun. There's also so many different spells and therefore ways you can choose to play. Personally I'm one of the people who pushed the map boundaries of the game from the start. Especially with the awesome magic parkour, I think everyone wants to go where they're not supposed to. Realistically, outside of that urge, I never had an issue with not being able to go where I wanted. While you might be locked out of chunks of the map until you progress in the main story, you never have a lack of things to explore. The map progression is related to the story progression in an understandable way and i think people that are upset about this are being far too picky.I've nearly 100% this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes this genre of game. I think my biggest complaint is that I wish the story was longer. I just wish I could play more.Warning! I highly recommend not trying to pick up every treasure chest. If you hit your inventory Max, you will be unable to pick up the chest. Most chest items are also crafting ingredients you can find in the over world. There is also an ungodly amount of chests in the game. After picking up 100% of the chests for the first 25% of the game I started to feel burnt out and was very upset when I found I couldn't pick up the next chest I found.",0,1,0.0

neointhematrix,http://www.metacritic.com/user/neointhematrix,"Feb 11, 2023",8,Positive,Almost all of the things said about this game are true... BUT... if you make a few tweaks to it (like turning down Cuffs comment frequency) the game becomes much better. This game is nowhere near as bad as people have said it is. I am really enjoying it and intend to finish it. I think some of the so called critics have a cast in stone game preference and if it's not their kind of game (like COD) they automatically don't like it and criticize it relentlessly. Yes it could use some patching in a few areas (like touchy non responsive controls at certain points) and I do agree about the likeability of Frey... But her character improves as you get farther into the game. I also think people criticize a game with just a few minutes of game play without really playing enough of it to do an honest and accurate assessment.,0,0,

She does a great job at making herself a character easy to dislike. It's like the writers are trying to make her cool, but are failing at it and coming off as cringe, on top of her overused cursing. I don't necessarily hate her, but I don't like her either. It's a pretty game with pretty magic but it isn't entirely horrible, but I feel you aren't missing out on much if you don't play it.

MikeyMcBride,http://www.metacritic.com/user/MikeyMcBride,"Feb  2, 2023",9,Positive,"I'm enjoying the game and I haven't even gotten to the first Tanta yet. Yes, the beginning/intro is slow and fairly empty, but the game opens up tremendously when on your way to Tanta Sila.The banter between Frey and Cuff can get repetitive, but there's an option adjust (or turn off) the banter in the settings. As for complaints of throwing around the f-bomb, Frey grew up as an orphan on the streets of NYC working for gangs to get by while also being homeless. She's not going to be some prim and proper princess with the vocabulary of a saint.Speaking of Frey and her attitude, I see a lot of people saying they don't like her because all she does is complain and not want to do anything. Well, yeah. She's living in a nightmare. She entered a world where literally everything is trying to kill her and she has to do it all alone because she's the only one that's not affected by the Break/Corruption. It's a scary, lonely world for Frey. Her reluctance to continue is understandable.The combat is fun and engaging. The further you go, the tougher the enemies get. However, even with just Frey's earth magic, I've been able to defeat multiple mutants (the big, scary monsters usually guarding chests). It takes time, but the challenge is exciting.Performance for me is great. I'm getting fairly steady 70-80 fps with settings maxed. No, it's not 120 (the game is capped at 120 fps), but this also isn't a fast-paced shooter or esport. As long as the frames are consistent and gameplay is smooth, that's all that's really necessary.I am disappointed with a couple things. The decision to keep Frey stationary to talk to Cuff after an interaction or cutscene is annoying. There's no point, let me walk and talk. On the topic of cutscenes, I was really hoping they'd match the quality of the trailer. If you're going to fade to black for every transition, then at least use rendered cutscenes. Monolith did an amazing job with the cutscenes in Shadow of Mordor/Shadow of War. I'd like to see more of that.Overall, I think the game is a ton of fun and deserves a chance.
