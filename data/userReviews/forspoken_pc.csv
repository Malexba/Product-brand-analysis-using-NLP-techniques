Just making the main character a black female New Yorker does not make a game woke. Check out the New York demographic. The real problems why Forspoken is a below average game are:1) technical issues (framerate drops, stuttering) graphically it's not impressive (will probably be fixed eventually)2) gameplay: it feels like watching a movie. Expect a LOT of cutscenes. Remember the ""interactive"" CD-ROM movies in the 1990s? First hour feels like that.3) Unlikable characters. No, it's not because she's black, so stow the ""racist!"" outcry. Faye is a total biotch. She's a terribly written, constantly cussing entitled, whiny POS. Unfortunately she isn't the only one. The talking bracelet is annoying as hell, several other character you wish you could just kill off to silence them (which you can't. I tried).4) expect pop-up triggers (press ""E"" to do this) and numbers (damage done) everywhere. The designers don't even trust you can do a sneak mission on your own: you have to follow a character (with a marker on top of her head!) as she does the sneaking for you!5) generic enemies with braindead AI and genereic, empty world6) it's $70 !!!

Это уровень игр 2014-15 годов, но никак не 2023 года. И ладно бы при такой графике она требовала бы столько же, сколько и они. Но нет, эту убогую игру еле вытягивают карты 40-ой серии...

Сам сюжет до ужаса вторичный, а наратив просто смешон: вместо катсцен с диалогами, операторской съемкой и так далее — статичные стеклянные статуи людей, которые обмениваются звуковой информацией (речью я это назвать не могу), а игроку предлагают слушать всю эту тягомотину по несколько минут и так 15+ раз за игры. Мммм, класс (нет)Может быть весь этот ужас перевесит интересный геймплей?) Нет)) И здесь разработчики наделали в штаны: играть в это абсолютно неинтересно, карта пустая, нет никаких точек интереса, кроме ""лабиринтов"" формы прямой кишки, где в конце нас ожидают одни и те же соперники, нет адекватных сайдквестов и заданий, кроме как ""ыы пойди убей монстров где-то там/ыы а теперь убей чуть больше монстров, но вот там/ыыы вот тут на полу мана валяется, собери ее ыыы"", нет никакого желания изучать мир этой игры, он просто пустой, как и сама игра.Вердикт: провал года, пустая трата времени и денег, наглая халтура и тревожный звонок игровой индустрии.",1,1,1.0

Which is a shame as I had this wishlisted forever since the Project Athia demo and expected good things, thinking they'd have elaborated on the foundation of Final Fantasy 15. They didn't. I only played it an hour and a half and I was done - what limited combat I was allowed to take part in was god-awful (if you played the Harry Potter Deathly Hallows games back in the day, where it's a third person shooter? Yeah, that. Fun.), the writing is interminably bad with an extremely irritating protagonist. The world building seemed encouraging enough, Athia wasn't terrible (as a world; the x-ray vision and stupid 'open world' tropes of collecting for the sake of collecting is paint-by-numbers dull), but not enough to pull anyone in because of the obvious other flaws. Because yeah, the real killer was the non-stop fade to black for cut scenes, every 10 seconds, over and over and over and over again. Unplayable. Had to refund as can't reward this game design - it's padding, nothing less than pointless padding. Also, it's unoptimised to a funny degree.

Такого лютого дерьма я давно не видел. Теперь по фактам.1. Персонажи говны.Главная героиня по всем канонам нынешней повестки нигерша, к тому же ""особенная"". Абсолютно все персонажи крайне бесят в своей тупости, лицемерии и убогости. За пример идти вообще не буду. 3 или 4 шлюхи поссорились и призвали демона. Они его победили, но не победили. Этот самый демон стал браслетами и прикрепился к каждой из этих сук, начав сводить их с ума. Как думаете, эти самые шлюхи, которые являются по совместительству правителями своих земель сделали хоть что то, чтоб уберечь своих подданных? Они их предупредили о том, что сойдут с ума? Нет! Нихуя подобного! В игре же из уст ГГ прозвучало примерно следующее ""Они являлись просто жертвами, а виноват демон"", при том, что именно они его и призвали!2. Логика говны.Тут все просто. Эти браслеты, являющиеся фактически частями демона сводили обладателей с ума. Это правило разрабы сами же и нарушили, показав гг во время сцены после титров, которая спокойно себе живёт с таким браслетом и даже с ним разговаривает. Так же логика вышла из чата потому, что у гг мать и отец белые, но при этом сама ""героиня"" является нигершой. Мать вместо того, чтоб отдать свою дочь отцу, просто выкидывает её в портал. В рандомное место и рандомное время. Попав в детский дом ещё младенцем гг получила имя. Замечу, что она могла получить абсолютно любое, хоть жопа залупина, но при этом эта сука выдает следующее ""так мать меня назвала в ее/его честь"", или что то в этом духе. И так со всем!3. Оптимизация и графика говны.Даже на 4090 ФПС порой падал до 57 кадров + фризы и другого рода говно. Эти партикли вообще бесполезны, хоть они так ими коечились. Можно было сделать куда красивее и менее ресурсозатратно. Графика хуже, чем в атсасине юнити, но это уже мем.4. Сюжет говны.Как и заведено в деловых дерьмоиграх/дерьмоаниме у нас тут гребаный исекай. Бомжиха бросила своего кота и исекайнулась в какой то фентезийный мир. Ее сразу все начали облизывать, мол какая она особенная и необычная, и так далее и так далее. По факту что мы имеем?1) Сплошные плоские клише про избранную/особенную/единственную и неповторимую.2) 12 глава просто зашквар. Все, из чего она состоит, так это из ""слезовыжималок"" и убогой экспозиции, чтоб отбелить боссов игры, мол ""они лишь жертвы, в во всем демон виноват. Такие они хорошие"" и не учитывая того, что именно эти бабы виноваты в смерти их мира.P.S. Эта игра идеально показывает то, что женщины у власти приведут цивилизацию в упадок, если не к полной аннигиляции, после чего перекинут всю вину на кого либо, лишь бы самим не отвечать за свои действия.

sumsulk,http://www.metacritic.com/user/sumsulk,"Jan 25, 2023",0,Negative,"Unfortunately, Metacritic does not have a page for the PC Demo unlike for the PS5 which it does, so I will leave my review of the demo here I was excited for the game when it was announced in 2020 and was actually thinking about buying it, however as time progressed and we got to see much more gameplay footage I came to realize that the game was becoming barebones as time goes on and this was verified when I played the demo released on Steam. Starting with the performance issues it is abysmal, there is no reason for this game to suck up 10 - 12GB of VRAM during gameplay and for some reason, there are these huge random pauses for 3-4 seconds. It is way worse than your individual stutters that were prevalent in the recent releases of The Callisto Protocol. Keep in mind I am running this game on an RTX 4090 paired with a 5950X at 1440p. I locked the FPS to 60 just to see if that would mitigate it and still no hope. Clearly, the devs have skimped on optimization. This is even confirmed when the recommended GPU is an RTX 3070 which is a high mid-range GPU. Moving onto gameplay, at best it's meh. It's nothing special or actually interesting while the game does give you the ability to switch between some sort of sword and range attack magic it just feels bland and boring. This isn't supported by the fact that the world is so desolate and empty with the occasional enemy NPCs here and there, I feel like Square Enix designed the world first and just sprinkled enemies randomly toward the end when they felt like they were rushing to meet the deadline. I won't speak for the story as this was just the demo, but I will finally point out that the bracelet thing is extremely annoying. Overall don't pick this game up right now, especially given the price point is $70 (US) feels like an absolute scam. Wait for a year or so for the bugs to be ironed out and sales to kick in. I feel like the game would probably be a decent buy for $25 ish but even that's asking for a lot",14,20,0.7

Putting aside what could become the soul of this game and completely forgetting the most important; The immersion, the quality of the narration, the passion for a story, the staging, the orchestration, the atmosphere... a video game. NOT a patchwork of INVESTMENT optimization CALCULATIONS. And, ""No!"", those who tell you that 32G ram is the norm today for PC gaming are only lying to themselves. All PC sites and other gamer products offer a 16G ram configuration. So we can nitpick by saying that a real proPC will build his bike himself - yes - but that doesn't change the fact that 95% of the general public will therefore be in 16g ram and that offering an optimization for 5% of the general public for a triple A, new license with great ambitions ... it's shooting yourself in the foot.

Constant fades to black and silent moments, the already slow pace of the story is further artificially slowed down ad-nauseum. The dialogue is very wooden, cliched and cringey, with awkward pauses between each line. The main character's performance is constantly over-acted and over-performed, over-expressed. Nothing here makes sense. Several dialogue/writing continuity errors. Plot hole every 10 minutes.Somewhat empty and lifeless world to explore.The main character often does things which make her unlikable, it's hard to immerse.Technically it's also badly coded/optimised, a sad reminder that modern developers and coders are using bloated, leaky untidy code. The game looks like it could've come out 8-10 years ago, but it plays like it needs a computer from the future. Overall, the game feels more like the product of board meetings and market research, with no heart or soul. The saving grace is the voice acting for Cuff, and some interesting environments, and some cool creatures/bosses.",6,10,0.6

And it all comes down to pretty much the story being boring, the main character being boring, the main villain being boring, and the voice acting being absolutey terrible in every way imaginable. This game also has a huge lack of polish, if its the performance or the glitches the game is just a mess. Lastly the gameplay which is mediocre most of it is boring like tailing missions and side quests in the mediocre open world but the combat is pretty good and fun, but still the open world gives you no insentive to play since the world is completely shallow.

Some people would say they wouldn't play this game unless they were paid to, but I say, where else can you waste $70 for a good cause? Now I know what you are thinking, the game is almost 50% cutscenes, with a boring, empty world, boring combat, diversity for the sake of wokeness, without any reasonable in world explanantion, a player character you want to push out a plane without a parachute, graphics that are both dated and unoptimized, and a story that reads like it was written by a child, without any internal continuity. All that may be true. However, keep in mind the people that made this game are all in one place, and they all failed, in every aspect. If you buy this game, they won't get fired, and if they don't get fired, they will continue being in one place making more incredibly bad games. On the other hand, if you do not buy this game, many, if not all of them, will be fired, then they will go to different companies, and many games will be worse for it. Think of this as a fee you pay to keep these people together, happily making terrible games, that you will also buy in the future to keep them together even longer. Where else can you pay $70 to contain such a destructive force? On a side note, the player character made it to my top 3 most annoying player characters ever list, right up there with the whiny idiots that you have to play as for FFX and FFXII.

naadrius,http://www.metacritic.com/user/naadrius,"Jan 27, 2023",9,Positive,"Really liking the game so far! Played the DEMO on PS5 so I knew what I was getting into. PROS:-Incredible loading times. Less than a second waiting after clicking „Continue“ from main menu. Appears to use DirectStorage 1.1 from .dll inspection.-Can save pretty much anywhere (no special save points or something like that).-Very fun gameplay and traversal. The combos you can do with magic are really cool. P.S. there is a way to instantly charge LV3 magic - really satisfying once you learn that.-No #StutterStruggle. If it stutters for you then I suggest check your VRAM usage. Also enabling Dynamic Resolution option causes strange stuttering for me at least. I suggest use DLSS - looks better and does not stutter.-Awesome HDR implementation. OLED TV users are in for a treat (HDR highlights really look insane on S95B OLED).-Good enough PC graphics settings (DLSS2 and FSR2 support, Ultrawide etc..)-Feels very good on K&M. Way better mouse support than FFXV (That game runs on the same engine). Menus work natively with mouse. CONS:-A lot of dialoge can appear too cringy for a lot of people it seems. I kinda like it tho. But I guess I am used to that type of dialogue in different JRPGs. Edit: after playing more the dialogue is really fine and makes sense to me. Also, Ella Balinska doing some fine VO work, good job!-GPU reqirements are really high. The demo area is not as demanding as some of the areas in the full game. I'm talking like 70-80fps in one area (the demo area to be precise) and ~55fps in another area. Both areas are tested in a non combat scenario. In combat it drops even more.-Graphics appear to be downgraded from very first 2020 trailers. Now it does look Next Gen in some scenes (Mostly in combat) while in other scenes reminds me of PS3 style lighting (Towns and some cutscenes or some non important NPC animations).-Not really that visible RT implementation (RTGI or RT Reflections would be really great additions)-Slow beggining chapters may put off some people (And a lot of janky animation work at the beggining). Tho I urge everyone to keep playing, it gets a lot better.-Quite high storage requirement. 121 GB on my SSD. Would love to give a higher rating to the game, but that lighting in most areas is pretty lame. Really strange to see a PS5/PC only game without dynamic time of day and that off putting lighting. Also I recommend playing on powerful PC, because as the time of writing 2023-01-27 the PS5 version runs really poorly. Review PC specs:CPU: i7-13700KFGPU: RTX 4080RAM: 32GB DDR5 5600MHZ CL36STORAGE: SAMSUNG 980 PRO (Heatsink version) Games runs at a mostly locked 60 FPS in 3840x2160 with maxed out settings and DLSS Balanced on this system. (DLSS Quality also works well, but has minor drops here and there). Edit: apparently in some more demangind areas I need to set DLSS to performance to prevent noticable drops. I do not think those areas are that much more striking visually to have such a pefromance cost tho. Maybe sometime a patch will make those areas run better.",2,17,0.11764705882352941

pkarapan77,http://www.metacritic.com/user/pkarapan77,"Jan 30, 2023",10,Positive,"Criminally underrated.  Everyone seems to be hyper focusing on either the race of the protagonist, or performance issues, both of which are honestly blown way out of proportion.  People complain there's never any new, original IPs.  Now we have one and everyone complains about it.  I guess that's gamers for you. Here's what to like:- Rich story and immersive world- Extremely fluid combat mechanics and movement through the world- Open world with interesting POIs- Cool looking architecture and style for Athia, the alternate world from our own, with subtle parallels to Earth- Many different spells to try and theorycraft around- Tongue in cheek main character that often unintentionally makes fun of herself in subtle ways- A sense of humour that isn't in your face obvious As for people complaining about the ""woke"" aspects of the game.  I'm a conservative. I hate the woke as much as anyone else. At first I listened to all the reviews on here saying the game was a woke dumpster fire. Nothing could be further from the truth. The game isn't woke at all. In fact it often makes fun of the main protagonist in subtle ways. It's one thing to take an existing IP and race swap or do something equally stupid, like trying to reform past history to conform to modern day sentiments.

Indeed, despite a beautiful world, I ended the game without exploring maybe 70% of the world and the reason for that lays in the lack of variety in the main quest to make us explore the world (it's mostly just go to the boss and we can do stuff on the way) and the lack of side quest. The side quest are non existent, just being useless objectives in the only city of the game. Forspoken would have been a 10/10 for me just by pushing us to explore more with real side quest and more diverse main quest.

ArchAngelAries,http://www.metacritic.com/user/ArchAngelAries,"Feb 10, 2023",1,Negative,"I was so hyped for this game.... I approached this open-world Isekai RPG with high expectations. The promise of a high-end, graphical, realistic game made by a AAA developer, featuring a spunky, female POC protagonist, had me excited to dive into the world Square Enix had created. However, upon playing the game, it became clear that while the game featured a vast map and decent graphics, the story and gameplay fell short of many of my expectations. The world-building and rewards for exploration were underwhelming, the story was dull and cringe-worthy, the MC and dialogue was horrendous, and the traversal and combat mechanics, even if fairly fun, were clunky and jarring. Here's my breakdown: Graphics- 4/10 - The graphics in this game are a mixed bag of beauty and disappointment. While the combat, animals, enemies, foliage, hair, clothes, magic, and most environments are breathtakingly gorgeous, the water looks stale and outdated, like it belongs in an unmodded 2011 Skyrim. The models and textures for human faces are decent, but the clunky and lifeless facial animations detract from the overall experience. The skybox also feels flat and unrealistic, even when all the settings are set to Ultra, and fails to inspire any sense of awe or beauty. The landscape, while still beautiful, is marred by poor quality sky and water. The NPCs in this game are generally dull and bland looking, with the exception of Frey and a few actors that were clearly 3D scanned. Clothing designs seem to have been given more attention than NPC faces and animations. Interestingly, the children in Athia are an exception to this trend, with their faces and facial animations being of a much higher quality than the adult NPCs, which compared to other titles is surprising, out of all the NPCs in this game it seems the children, Frey, enemies, and animals are the most well done. The combat, magic, and other areas of the game are visually stunning, but ultimately fall short of a cohesive Next Gen appeal that the marketing materials implied. Worldbuilding - 9/10 - The map is pretty big, I'd wager to say it's about on par with HZD in size; there's plenty of notes and books and things to read and learn to deepen your understanding of the world and it's lore. Not much to say here, the world building felt pretty solid, the only thing that knocked a point off for me was the cringey and unrealistic commentary that starkly contrasted with the tone in the menus. Traversal - 4/10 - The game's movement mechanics are pretty fun, but alas, the parkour abilities are unfortunately hampered by invisible walls and other restrictive elements in cities. Understandably, the game disables magical traversal in certain cities, but it left me feeling cheated as I had hoped to jump and explore on rooftop using parkour throughout the game, which seemed implied by the game earlier on. Furthermore, certain areas and parts of the story force you to walk at a slow pace or prevent climbing, running, and exploring, whether due to poor collisions or simply being restricted by design, which is irksome. In summary, the traversal can be fun but is ultimately hindered by limitations in exploration and unresponsive parkour. Combat - 3/10 - The combat in the game is fairly fun to an extent, with a large skill tree to upgrade abilities, but many skills do not feel organically earned, just ""you earned enough XP and here you go, you can unlock this now"". Mixing of combat seems clunky and unintuitive, making it hard to stream combos and apply style with parkour system. The game also forces you to switch abilities on the fly with cool-down periods and slow recovery times. Dodging is fun, but seems to be introduced at the wrong point in the story, making it feel inorganic. The magic abilities are gorgeous but not well set up for chain combos, relying more on spamming and taking you out of the action with slowed menu switching. Overall, it feels like Square Enix was trying to mix Witcher 3, PS4 Spider-man, Dark Souls, and Horizon Zero Dawn combat systems, but fails to implement them in a cohesive way, leaving you with a decently fun but not overly enjoyable combat system. Story - 1/10 - The story in this game is an utter failure, with cringey dialogue, nonsensical character traits, an overly mean and un-relatable main character, missed story beats, mis-paced, and overall destruction of the suspension of disbelief. The Isekai plot points are non-existent beyond the very basic ""transported to a new world and now have superpowers"", and seems devoid of making friends or any romantic interest. The plot is predictable and shallow, as if it was written by a 6th grader. Unfunny, cringey, forgettable and boring, it put me to sleep twice so far and I am left wondering if I'll even be able to finish the game. Overall Score - 1/10 - fun to play overall, but the story and other negative points make this game very boring, un-intuitive and nauseatingly cringey.",0,0,
SergeiZ,http://www.metacritic.com/user/SergeiZ,"Feb  5, 2023",2,Negative,"That's horrible. Everything is terrible: optimization, design, plot, and voice acting.1) Graphics are similar to assets for UE4 and generated from UE5.  You get tired of the same texture patterns very quickly.2) The game does not work well even on modern hardware.3) The fights are very boring. Many bosses do not pose any danger at all, they only require time from the player.4) The worst thing is the plot: the character does not cause any sympathy. That's what prevented the girl from being just a nice person? The story is dull. It's not fun to follow him.5) The voice acting of the characters is just a nightmare. I don't know who might like this game. Maybe those people who have not played video games for the last 20 years and after Tetris will accidentally see this?",0,0,

Why this kind of story and shamefull storytelling.And why spending millions and working thousands of hours on this shamefull storytelling instead of creating a nice athmospheric realistic world without cringe?The world they tried to tell me isnt credible at all.Really sorry for the hard work spending on this but - naaaaah. not again",0,0,

KinimodYunmi,http://www.metacritic.com/user/KinimodYunmi,"Mar  3, 2023",9,Positive,"Ich hatte immer sehr viel Lust das Spiel möglichst lange und am nächsten Tag direkt wieder zu spielen. Das Spiel hat mich sehr gefesselt, Frey ist ein top Hauptcharakter! Es gibt verdammt viele Fähigkeiten mit einem Konzept, sie alle auseinanderhalten zu können und auch immer wieder einsetzen zu wollen. Die Grafik ist in der riesigen Open World von größeren Konstrukten (Hauptstadt ausgenommen) verloren gegangen oder noch nicht vorhanden, aber das überwiegt das schnelle und vor allem fantastische Gameplay aber mehr als genug. Man hat für alle 4 Elemente/Skill-Tree´s 3 Angriffszauber, die entweder halb-automatisch oder vollautomatisch eingesetzt werden können, die meisten davon können auch 3 Stufen lang aufgeladen werden und nochmal einen extra starken Schuss abgeben. Dann gibt es ca. 10 Unterstützungsmagien, die Target-Zauber, AOE, Heal, Buff oder Defense-Zauber sind.Jede Elementmagie hat nochmal eine Schubmagie, welche eine extrem starke Magie, die über Einsatz von Unterstützungs- und Angriffsmagie aufgeladen wird. Diese hat ebenfalls drei aufladbare Stufen und haut ordentlich rein. Die Story ist am Anfang sehr präsent, ungefähr zum Verlassen der Hauptstadt. Dann ist man erstmal auf die Open World losgelassen und ich für meinen Teil fand das völlig in Ordnung, ich wollte erstmal erkunden, alle Open World Aktivitäten kennenlernen und dann erstmal alles weiter auf dem Weg bis zum Questgebiet abarbeiten. In der Mainquest kommt man später auf Grund der vielen Zauber teilweise auch gar nicht, dafür bekommt man eine sehr schöne Story vorgesetzt. Danach hat man mehr Fähigkeiten, die man erstmal alle vollumfänglich ausprobieren möchte und dafür ist die große Open World perfekt, in die man sich dann stürzen kann, um alles auszuprobieren und auch sonst macht es einfach Spaß in riesen Gegnermenge reinzurennen und alles einzusetzen was man hat, mir hat das gesamte Spiel (mit Abstand sehr vielen anderen Spielen) sehr gefallen!",0,0,

edisonkum,http://www.metacritic.com/user/edisonkum,"Mar 19, 2023",0,Negative,"As a passionate gamer, it's always disheartening to come across a game that fails to meet even the most basic expectations. Sadly, that was precisely the experience I had when I played Forspoken, a game that was supposed to be a thrilling adventure but turned out to be an exercise in political correctness and social justice. One of the biggest issues with the game was its content, which was chock-full of social justice and political correctness that had no place in the gameplay. While it's essential to have representation and inclusivity in games, it's another matter entirely when the storyline and mechanics are overshadowed by these issues. Unfortunately, that's precisely what happened with Forspoken, where the political messages felt forced, preachy, and often completely irrelevant to the gameplay. The game's storyline was also disappointing, as it seemed more interested in pushing its political agenda than providing an exciting, immersive experience. The characters were shallow and one-dimensional, with their entire existence seemingly defined by their gender, ethnicity, or sexuality. It was as if the game was trying to tick off a checklist of diversity rather than focusing on creating a compelling story with memorable characters. Even worse, the gameplay itself suffered from the game's political agenda. The mechanics were often clunky, and the controls were frustratingly difficult to master, making the game almost unplayable. It felt like the developers had focused so much on pushing their message that they forgot that the game itself needed to be enjoyable to play. Overall, Forspoeken was a massive disappointment, with its heavy-handed political messages and irrelevant social justice content detracting from what could have been a genuinely exciting gaming experience. While representation and inclusivity are essential, they should never come at the expense of gameplay or story. If you're looking for a game that delivers on both counts, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.",0,0,
