This project is a collection of 7 Jupyter Notebooks that cover all the steps required in a data science process, from data extraction to topic modelling and sentiment analysis. Besides from the notebooks, this repository also includes the data obtained from Metacritic through web scraping as well as the models and wordclouds generated in the notebooks. However, due to the file size limitations of Github, it does not include the data obtained through the Twitter API. The entire project, including that last data (folders *Furbo* and *Videojocs*), can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V-ORQ2xIVK1q-uPFZiCTsiemjf7oGzGy).

These notebooks offer a comparison between the three main companies in the game industry: **Nintendo**, **Playstation** and **Xbox**; as well as their respective exclusive launches at the end of January 2023 (**Fire Emblem Engage**, **Forspoken** and **Hi-Fi Rush**). We perform topic modeling in order to look for the most relevant topics that are related to each company, along with sentiment analysis to find the perceived sentiment of each company and the reception their games have received.

Despite the fact that the final [report](./SpanishReport.pdf) and the [defence](./Presentacion.pptx) of the project was completely done in Spanish, since this is a bachelor's degree final project of a degree course in Spain, it has also been included an English version of both the [report](./Report.pdf) and the [presentation](./Presentation.pptx).
